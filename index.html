    <p><em>Testability</em> - the idea that code should be written so that it&#8217;s easy to write tests for - has been on my mind for a while.</p>
<p>Ned Batchelder has a good presentation on <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/testability.html">Tests and Testability</a>, where he talks about using function parameters instead of implicit dependencies and composition instead of inheritance, to write code that can be unit tested quickly and easily using dependency injection.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">Boundaries</a> Gary Bernhardt introduces an idea he calls <em>functional core, imperative shell</em>. The idea is that each function or method in your code is one of two types:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Functional core</dt>
<dd>
<p>These are functions that take values in as parameters, and give values out as return values. They use explicit parameters instead of implicit dependencies. They have few or no side effects, and each one of these functions is very well isolated from the rest of the code.</p>
<p>You try to put all the logic and decisions of your code into these &#8220;pure functions&#8221;, so there are many potential paths through one of these functions. But you try to keep things like the network, the database, rendering to the screen, disk, etc out of these functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Imperative shell</dt>
<dd>
<p>These &#8220;shell functions&#8221; are where all the side effects and persistent state go: the network and database etc. They are highly integrated with the rest of your code and with other code that you&#8217;re using (e.g. your web framework).</p>
<p>You try to keep logic and decisions out of the shell functions, there should be few possible paths through a shell function (ideally only one). If possible, they should be trivial one-liner functions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Writing code in this way has many advantages. All the logic is in the pure functions which are very modular and easy to understand. They&#8217;re also <em>much</em> easier to test, and you can get 99% coverage by just testing your pure functions and ignoring the shell.</p>
<h2 id="an-oauth-20-plugin-for-ckan">An OAuth 2.0 plugin for CKAN</h2>
<p>I tried to apply this approach when writing <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-oauth2waad">ckanext-oauth2waad</a>, a <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> plugin that lets users login to a CKAN site using their Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD) account instead of creating a new username and password for the site.</p>
<p>The way it works is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user goes to the CKAN site&#8217;s login page, where they see a &#8220;Login with WAAD&#8221; link that links them to the WAAD login server. This link contains a <strong>redirect URI</strong> as a URL parameter that tells the WAAD server where to redirect the user&#8217;s browser to after a successful login: <code>?redirect_uri=http://my.ckan.site/_waad_redirect_uri</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user clicks on the link and is taken to a WAAD login page. They enter their username and password, and then the WAAD server redirects their browser to the redirect URI. The servers appends an <strong>authorization code</strong> to the redirect URI as a URL param: <code>?code=ffhjkl434387jlkmdfsas</code>.</p>
<p>(If the user is already logged-in to WAAD, the server can just redirect them right away without any user interaction.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CKAN receives the browser&#8217;s request to its redirect URI. Server-side, CKAN pulls the auth code out of the URL params and uses it to make an HTTP request to the WAAD server for the user&#8217;s name. The WAAD server responds with the user&#8217;s username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CKAN looks for the CKAN user corresponding to the user name from the WAAD server. If no CKAN user exists yet, it uses the user name to create one (silently, the user doesn&#8217;t know the difference). CKAN logs the user into their account, and redirects them to their dashboard page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s also a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) check, but we&#8217;ll ignore that for this explanation.</p>
<p>This is how the &#8220;login experience&#8221; looks, from the user&#8217;s point of view:</p>
<img alt="Logging into CKAN with Windows Azure Active Directory" src="http://seanh.cc/images/oauth2waad.gif" style="border: none;">
<p>Steps 3 and 4 of the above process are implemented by the <code>oauth2waad</code> plugin&#8217;s <code>login()</code> method. This is the method that CKAN calls to handle requests to its redirect URI.</p>
<h2 id="a-nave-implementation">A na&#239;ve implementation</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a na&#239;ve implementation of the <code>login()</code> method:</p>
<pre>
<code>class WAADRedirectController(toolkit.BaseController):

    def login(self):
        """Handle a login request from the WAAD server.

        When the WAAD server wants to log a user into our CKAN site, it
        redirects the user's browser to a CKAN URL that routes to this
        login() method.

        The URL params contain an auth code which we can use to get the
        user's name from the WAAD server, and then log the user in to CKAN
        by saving the name in CKAN's session.

        """
        # Look for the auth code in the URL that the WAAD server requested
        # from CKAN.
        auth_code = pylons.request.params['code']

        # The data that we're going to post to the WAAD server.
        # This includes a secret client ID from CKAN's config file
        # (which we access via the pylons.config object).
        data = {
            'client_id': pylons.config['client_id'],
            'code': auth_code,
            }

        # Use the requests library to make an HTTP POST request to the WAAD
        # server.
        response = requests.post(
            pylons.config['waad_server_url'], data=data)

        # Parse the response to get the user's name.
        name = response.json()['name']

        # Find the CKAN user account corresponding to this WAAD user account.
        try:
            user = toolkit.get_action('user_show')(data_dict = {'id': name})
        except toolkit.ObjectNotFound:
            # The user doesn't exist in CKAN yet, create it by calling the
            # CKAN API.
            user = toolkit.get_action('user_create')(
                context={'ignore_auth': True}, data_dict={'name': name})

        # Log the user in to CKAN by adding their name to the Pylons
        # session.
        pylons.session['user'] = name
        pylons.session.save()

        # Finally, show the user their dashboard page.
        toolkit.redirect_to(controller='user', action='dashboard',
                            id=name)
</code>
</pre>
<p>(This is a simplified version of the method, the production code contains a lot of error-handling and other details, but the above code is closely based on the real thing.)</p>
<h2 id="testing-the-nave-implementation">Testing the na&#239;ve implementation</h2>
<p>The code is quite simple, straightforward and readable. But the na&#239;ve implementation is <em>very</em> difficult to test. Some of the things you&#8217;ll have to do to write a test for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resetting CKAN&#8217;s test database before each test, because the CKAN API functions that the method calls write things to the database that may change the outcome of the next tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running CKAN inside a test web server that can simulate HTTP requests for us. (We can do this using a <a href="http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/">webtest</a> <code>TestApp</code> object.)</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t just initialize a <code>WAADRedirectController</code> object and call its <code>login()</code> method. <code>WAADRedirectController</code> inherits from <code>ckan.plugins.toolkit.BaseController</code> which means it depends on a bunch of CKAN and Pylons internals and will crash if initialized outside of a Pylons HTTP request. If you do this:</p>
<pre>
<code>import ckanext.oauth2waad.plugin as plugin

def test_login():
    controller = plugin.WAADRedirectController()
    controller.login()
</code>
</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll get this:</p>
<pre>
<code>TypeError: No object (name: request) has been registered for this thread
</code>
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Inserting test values into the Pylons config.</p>
<p>Simply initializing a <code>TestApp</code> for CKAN won&#8217;t work because the <code>oauth2waad</code> plugin won&#8217;t be activated, and the various config settings that the plugin needs will be missing. Each test function needs to insert the particular settings that it needs into the <code>pylons.config</code> first and then create the test app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking the WAAD server, because when we request CKAN&#8217;s login URL the <code>login()</code> method tries to make an HTTP request to the WAAD server to get the user&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>We need to mock the response to this HTTP request, which we can do using the <a href="http://falcao.it/HTTPretty/">HTTPretty</a> library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking the Pylons session.</p>
<p>Our test needs to access the Pylons session so that it can check that the <code>login()</code> method did what it was supposed to do: save the user&#8217;s name in the session.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t simply <code>import pylons</code> and access the Pylons session from our test function. If we try to do this at the end of our test function:</p>
<pre>
<code>assert pylons.session['user'] == 'fred', (
    "login() should add the user's name to the Pylons session")
</code>
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;ll get:</p>
<pre>
<code>TypeError: No object (name: session) has been registered for this thread
</code>
</pre>
<p>The Pylons session is only available during an HTTP request. To get around this, we&#8217;ll have to use the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock">mock</a> library to patch <code>pylons.session</code> and replace it with a mock session object.</p>
<p>If we simply do <code>@mock.patch(pylons.session)</code> we&#8217;ll get mock objects leaking into CKAN&#8217;s internals and a variety of confusing error messages from CKAN, Pylons and SQLAlchemy (as SQLAlchemy tries to save mock objects into database tables, for example).</p>
<p>The reason for this leakage is that <code>pylons.session</code> has many different names in different parts of CKAN (which is poor design in CKAN, imho). Lots of CKAN modules do this:</p>
<pre>
<code>from pylons import session
</code>
</pre>
<p>When <code>ckan/lib/base.py</code> does that, for example, we now need to patch both <code>pylons.session</code> <em>and</em> <code>ckan.lib.base.session</code>.</p>
<p>We have to find each different name for <code>pylons.session</code> that our test happens to hit and patch each of them separately. This tightly couples our test code to CKAN internal details in a way that will be difficult to debug when those internals change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes hours to write a test for this and find ways around all of these obstacles, and it requires deep knowledge of CKAN and Pylons, as well as using test libraries for mocking, patching and simulating. The test code that you&#8217;ll finally end up with will look something like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>import json
import webtest
import httpretty
import mock
import pylons.config as config
import ckan.config.middleware
import ckan.model as model

@mock.patch('pylons.session')
@mock.patch('ckan.lib.helpers.session')
@mock.patch('ckan.lib.base.session')
@httpretty.activate
def test_login(mock_base_session, mock_helpers_session, mock_session):
    """login() should add the user's name to the session."""
    # Reset the database contents before each test.
    model.Session.close_all()
    model.repo.rebuild_db()

    # Mock the Pylons session.
    session_dict = {}
    def getitem(name):
        return session_dict[name]
    def get(name):
        return session_dict.get(name)
    def setitem(name, val):
        session_dict[name] = val
    mock_session.__getitem__.side_effect = getitem
    mock_session.get.side_effect = get
    mock_session.__setitem__.side_effect = setitem

    # Mock the WAAD server.
    waad_server_url = 'https://fake.auth.endpoint/tenant/token'
    def request_callback(request, url, headers):
        """Our mock WAAD server response."""
        # The params that will go in the response's JSON body.
        params = {'name': 'fred'}

        body = json.dumps(params)
        return (200, headers, body)
    httpretty.register_uri(httpretty.POST, waad_server_url,
                        body=request_callback)

    # Insert the settings we need into the Pylons config.
    config['ckan.plugins'] = 'oauth2waad'
    config['client_id'] = 'mock_client_id'
    config['waad_server_url'] = waad_server_url

    # Make a CKAN test app.
    app = ckan.config.middleware.make_app(config['global_conf'],
                                            **config)
    app = webtest.TestApp(app)

    # Make a simulated HTTP POST request to the login URL.
    app.post('/_waad_redirect_uri', {'code': 'mock_auth_code'})

    # Test that the login() method added the user name into the mock Pylons
    # session.
    assert mock_session['user'] == 'fred'
</code>
</pre>
<p>This single test takes about <em>twenty seconds</em> to run, mostly because of the time needed to boot the whole CKAN web app inside the test web server and initialize its database. Even after this initialization the test isn&#8217;t particularly fast, it&#8217;s exercising the full CKAN app.</p>
<p>This is a simplified version of the test, for a simplified version of the <code>login()</code> method. The real test would be much longer, and you&#8217;d need many such tests to test all the paths through the real <code>login()</code> method with all its error handling and everything.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-implementation">A better implementation</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s try an alternative implementation of the <code>login()</code> method that moves most of the code into pure, standalone functions and leaves only a minimal imperative shell.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll factor two kinds of dependencies out of our pure functions:</p>
<p><strong>Incoming dependencies</strong> are things that call us: the controller class and method that we need to create in order to get CKAN to call our code.</p>
<p>We factor out the incoming dependencies by moving our code out of the class&#8217;s <code>login()</code> method and into a standalone <code>_login()</code> function, and turning the original <code>login()</code> method into a one-liner that calls the <code>_login()</code> function.</p>
<p>We can now test the <code>_login()</code> function by importing our plugin module and calling the function directly - we don&#8217;t need to initialize a <code>WAADRedirectController</code> object.</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing dependencies</strong> are things that we call: the <code>pylons.request.params</code> object that we get the auth code from, the <code>pylons.config</code> object that we get config settings from, the <code>requests.post()</code> function (from the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/">requests</a> library) that we use to make the HTTP request to the WAAD server, the <code>pylons.session</code> object that we save the user&#8217;s name to, and the <code>ckan.plugins.toolkit.redirect_to()</code> function that we call to redirect the browser to the user&#8217;s dashboard.</p>
<p>We factor these out by having the <code>_login()</code> function take them as parameters. Instead of calling <code>requests.post()</code> directly for example, it takes a callable as a <code>post</code> param and calls that. The <code>login()</code> method passes a <code>requests.post()</code> wrapper function as the argument to this post param. When we come to writing our tests, we can simply pass in a mock post function.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the refactored code:</p>
<pre>
<code>def _post(endpoint, data):
    """Make an HTTP POST request and return the JSON from the response."""
    return requests.post(endpoint, data).json()

class WAADRedirectController(toolkit.BaseController):

    def login(self):
        """Handle requests to the WAAD redirect_uri."""
        _login(
            pylons.request.params,
            pylons.config['client_id'],
            pylons.config['waad_server_url'],
            _post,
            pylons.session,
            toolkit.redirect_to)

def _login(params, client_id, waad_server_url, post, session, redirect):

    name = _get_user_name_from_waad(params, client_id, waad_server_url,
                                    post)

    user = _log_the_user_in(session, name)

    redirect(controller='user', action='dashboard', id=name)

def _get_user_name_from_waad(params, client_id, waad_server_url, post):
    """Request the user's name from the WAAD server and return it."""

    data = {'client_id': client_id, 'code': params['code']}
    response_json = post(waad_server_url, data=data)
    return response_json['name']

def _log_the_user_in(...):
    ...
</code>
</pre>
<p>With the code refactored so, we can now write our tests like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>import ckanext.oauth2waad.plugin as plugin

def test_get_user_name_from_waad():
    """get_user_name_from_waad() should return the user name from the WAAD server."""

    def post(endpoint, data):
        """A mock HTPP post() function.

        Just returns a mock response from the WAAD server containing a mock
        user name, without actually making any HTTP request.

        """
        return {'name': 'fred'}

    # The params of the request to CKAN's redirect URI.
    params = {'code': 'fake_auth_code'}

    name = plugin._get_user_name_from_waad(
        params, 'fake client id', 'fake waad server url', post)

    assert name == 'fred'
</code>
</pre>
<p>This test code is <em>much</em> shorter and simpler, much quicker and easier to write, and the test runs in 0.008s.</p>
<p>The only bit of code that can&#8217;t be covered by unit testing <code>_get_user_name_from_waad()</code> and the other pure functions directly is the <code>WAADRedirectController</code>&#8217;s <code>login()</code> method, which contains just a single function call. We could either leave this untested and settle for 99% coverage, or we could add a single integration test for the simplest happy path through the code, and leave all the details to be covered by the unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="mocking-the-ckan-api">Mocking the CKAN API</h2>
<p>The <code>_log_the_user_in()</code> function not shown above has to find the CKAN user corresponding to the name from the WAAD server, create the user if it doesn&#8217;t already exist, and then log the user in by adding the user to the Pylons session.</p>
<p><code>_log_the_user_in()</code> can be written and tested in the same way as we&#8217;ve done for <code>_get_user_name_from_waad()</code> above. But this function has a couple of outgoing dependencies that we haven&#8217;t seen yet. It has to call two CKAN API methods: <code>user_show()</code> and <code>user_create()</code> (both must be called via <code>ckan.plugins.toolkit.get_action()</code>). If the function tries to call these API functions when it&#8217;s being run by our tests, that&#8217;s going to be slow (those API functions pull in all sorts of CKAN code, and they access the database) and it&#8217;s probably going to crash with some weird CKAN, Pylons or SQLAlchemy error because they expect to be called during a Pylons HTTP request.</p>
<p>It would be fairly simple to use mock to patch <code>ckan.plugins.toolkit.get_action()</code> during our tests, replacing it with a mock <code>get_action()</code> function that returns mock <code>user_show()</code> and <code>user_create()</code> functions. But that would tightly couple our test code to internal details of both our plugin and CKAN. Our test now needs to know about three implicit dependencies of <code>_log_the_user_in()</code>: <code>get_action()</code>, <code>user_show()</code> and <code>user_create()</code>, and it needs to know that the mock <code>get_action()</code> function should return the mock <code>user_show()</code> or the mock <code>user_create()</code> if called with the argument <code>'user_show'</code> or <code>'user_create'</code> respectively, and that <code>_log_the_user_in()</code> shouldn&#8217;t call <code>get_action()</code> with any other arguments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much simpler and better to add <code>user_show</code> and <code>user_create</code> arguments to the <code>_log_the_user_in()</code> function and have the <code>login()</code> shell method pass in CKAN&#8217;s real <code>user_show()</code> and <code>user_create()</code> functions as arguments, just like we did with <code>requests.post()</code> when testing <code>_get_user_name_from_waad()</code>. Then our test function can simply pass in its own mock functions.</p>
<p>This dependency injection approach makes for long parameter lists, but it keeps the dependencies of our functions nice and explicit and it lets us avoid the mock library entirely.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following this technique might feel like refactoring our production code &#8220;just&#8221; to make the test code nicer. It can seem obtuse at first to have a <code>login()</code> method that calls a <code>_login()</code> function with a long list of parameters, instead of just putting the code directly in the <code>login()</code> method. Passing in <code>requests.post()</code> as a parameter instead of just calling it directly also feels needlessly indirect at first.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d argue that testability is a very good reason to design your code in a particular way. Tests are important, and if you&#8217;re testing thoroughly then you&#8217;re going to be spending just as much time writing tests as writing production code (or more, if your tests are hard to write because your production code isn&#8217;t easy to test!).</p>
<p>Designing for testability with a <em>functional core, imperative shell</em> approach also tends to make your code very modular, which is great for readability and reuse as well.</p>

    <p>For the first time, I actually attended the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/">OKFestival</a>. I didn&#8217;t get to attend many sessions, but the conversations I&#8217;ve had are spectacular.</p>
<p>The first surprise was meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/malev">malev</a>. A couple of years ago, we both worked together on the Ubuntu project. Now, he&#8217;s an Open News Fellow and I work at Open Knowledge. The FOSS world is truely small :-)</p>
<p>I <em>finally</em> got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/christi3k">Christie</a>! I&#8217;ve heard of Christie since right before she started at Mozilla, when I first heard of <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a>, and later she started at Mozilla Webdev, where I was closely involved back then.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgFritzsche">Georg</a> came over to say hi on Tuesday. When I realized that he was in Uganda for the Mozfest East Africa, I introduced him to Ketty who was also there, leading to an interesting conversation and great connection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xvt.com.au/">George Sattler</a> works for XVT solutions in Australia and is our partner. He is fairly certain that I don&#8217;t sleep ;) We&#8217;ve been having conversations over email for quite a long time and it was great to meet George in person.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve met <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/">Adam Green</a>, the editor of Public Domain Review. It was nice catching up with him. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpekel">Joris</a>! I hadn&#8217;t seen him since he moved on from OKF :-)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t met <a href="https://twitter.com/ajantriks">Riju</a> since he&#8217;s moved to Delhi and I met him in Berlin! Totally random and great running into him :)</p>
<p>The last I met <a href="https://twitter.com/houndbee">Kaustubh</a> was at Pranesh&#8217;s farewell party in October (?). We had a good time catching up.</p>
<p>Folks from local groups across OKF. As a part-time system, I talk to most of the OKF community folks at some point through RT. Additionally, I was going around asking feedback for the sysadmin team. It was great for me to put a face to names and I suspect vice versa as well.</p>
<p>The usual suspects who were great to meet, are of course, my lovely teammates. It&#8217;s nice to meet in person, grab a drink, and talk.</p>
<p>Congratulations again to Bea, Megan, Lou, and Naomi for making OKFestival happen!</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago, I requested <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1030618">L3 access</a> as part of my <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Sheriffing">Sheriffing</a> work and my request was granted. I think I&#8217;ve totally jinxed things since then ;)</p>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="The tree. IT'S BURNING!" src="http://nigelb.me/img/fire.gif"></div>
<p>The first Sunday afterward, we had a patch that was landed into aurora inadvertently causing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1031697">massive spike</a> in crashes. I saw it myself and suspect that my copy was corrupt and downloaded the latest! Of course, to no avail. I finally noticed the right bug and Kairo was looking for someone to back it out. I backed it out and triggered a rebuild which fixed the issue.</p>
<p>The next Saturday, we had <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1034807">mobile imaging failures</a>. This one was fun fixing, I talked to Nick Thomas and Chris Cooper on the phone. All it needed was one command, but it took us some time to get there :-) But hey, it got me mentioned under <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2014-07-07#Friends_of_Mozilla">Friends of Mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>Having more access to fix things somehow makes me feel responsible!</p>

    <p>On the last Monday of April, I found myself nervously standing in a room of about 15 people from the e-Government Agency and National Bureau of Statistics in Dar es Salaam. They were waiting for me to start training them in Python and CKAN. I&#8217;ve been programming in Python since 2011, but I&#8217;ve never actually trained people in Python. On the first day, I didn&#8217;t have any slides. All I had was one [PDF][pdf] from Wikibooks which I was using as material. I didn&#8217;t even cover the whole material. By the end of the day though, I could sense that it was sinking into the attendees a bit.</p>
<p>It all started with an email from my manager asking me if I was available to do a training in Tanzania in April. After lots of back and forth, we finalized on a date and a trainer to assist in the trainings, and I flew in. Dar es Salaam, strangely, reminded of growing up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salalah">Salalah</a>. I got in a day early to prep for the week and settle in. The trainer looking groggy on a Monday does not bode well!</p>
<p>People who train often don&#8217;t tell you this - Trainings are exhausting. You&#8217;re most likely to be on your feet all day and walk around the room helping people who&#8217;re lagging behind. Looking back, the training was both fun and exhausting. I enjoyed talking about Python, though I feel like I need more practice to do it well. The <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> training, I was pretty satisfied with the outcome, by the end of the week, the folks from e-Gov Agency went in and setup a server with CKAN!</p>
<p>Note to self: Write these posts immediately after the trip before I forget :-)</p>

  <div style="max-width:43em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; overflow:hidden;">
    <p>About 2 weeks ago, I <a href="http://nigelb.me/2014-05-25-a-migration-plan.html">kicked off</a> my &#8220;evil&#8221; plan to move as many things as possible off Google Apps. I&#8217;ve managed to move my Contacts, Calendar, and files off Google services so far.</p>
<p>I setup <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> for contacts, calendar, and files. It was incredibly painless to setup. I have the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android">owncloud</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.caldav.lib">CalDAV-sync</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.carddav.Sync">CardDAV-Sync</a> apps installed on my Android phone and it seems to work great. Good enough that the only thing I&#8217;m syncing from my Google account is email.</p>
<p>The ownCloud app was straight forward. I checked the option to instantly upload pictures. This allowed me to disable picture syncing with Google Photos.</p>
<p>The next app I tried was CardDAV-Sync. I tried the free one first. It didn&#8217;t actually sync anything to my server. Searching around a bit suggested that I might have to import the contacts to the server first. So, I backed up the contacts to a file and synced that to the ownCloud instance. When I clicked on the VCF file on the ownCloud server, it let me import the contacts from it immediately. The problem with Google syncing all my contacts it that there were 1000+ contacts that I had to clean up, purge, and finally arrive at close to 400. I should delete more, but I haven&#8217;t had spare time to do that.</p>
<p>CalDAV was fairly easy, exported the calendars, imported them into ownCloud, installed the app, and removed the Google calendars from being displayed.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the status so far on my roadmap:</p>
<ol>
<li>[Done] Sign up for fastmail.</li>
<li>[Ongoing] Move all the Gtalk contacts to Jabber on fastmail.</li>
<li>[<strong>Done</strong>] Set up ownCloud for docs, contacts, and calendar.</li>
<li>[<strong>Done</strong>] Copy documents, contacts, and calendar entries to ownCloud.</li>
<li>[Todo] Setup mutt to use with fastmail.</li>
<li>[Todo] Archive emails from gmail.</li>
<li>[Todo] Turn lights off at Google Apps account.</li>
<li>[Todo] Set reply-to headers for gmail.com account to fastmail account.</li>
<li>[Todo] Regular backup/archiving strategy for ownCloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m using a Google Spreadsheet to track my budget and this is where I anticipate trouble. I haven&#8217;t found an online tool that I can use as well I have managed with this spreadsheet that I&#8217;ve perfected over the last few years. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.</p>
<p>Additionally, this is not cheaper than using Google for sure. I&#8217;m definitely paying more in terms of server space and backup space for this.</p>

    <p>I signed up for MozCamp India just before the deadline and now I&#8217;ve emailed the organizers that I will not be attending.</p>
<p>Primarily, the event is focused on increasing the numbers of the Mozilla community to 1 million. While this seems exciting, actually going about the process of making it happen doesn&#8217;t excite me. The event, as far as I can see, is heavily targeted at Mozilla Reps. At my first Mozcamp, multiple people suggested that I should join Mozilla Reps. I have same the answer to that question now as I had back then - with the limited amount of time I have, I prefer to <a href="http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/proglang">code</a> or <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Sheriffing">watch trees</a>. These are activities that I enjoy doing.</p>

<p>The last few months have involved quite a bit of travel. For instance, I&#8217;m writing this in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where I&#8217;m talking to folks at the National Bureau of Statistics and e-Government Agency about <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a>. I think I would want a few weekends to myself so that I don&#8217;t burn out.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m a bit disappointed that I won&#8217;t be attending the Mozilla event in <strong>my</strong> city and I do hope it&#8217;s a successful event. All the best to Mozilla India and events team!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve spent the last month in Delhi, mostly having fun and spending time with friends. Remote working does have the advantage that I can work from anywhere as long as there&#8217;s power and an Internet connection. I&#8217;m not a very touristy person, but here&#8217;s a few places I visited out of peer pressure and curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="cr-parkcrpark"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittaranjan_Park">CR Park</a></h2>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="I found Diagon Alley!" src="http://nigelb.me/img/crpark.jpg"></div>
<p>If you have a Bengali friend in Delhi, the chances are quite high that you have been dragged there (er, convinced to visit). In total, I went there 3 times during my stay and each time, I found the food spectacular. More amusing is the feeling that I&#8217;m not in Delhi anymore. I hear Bengali everywhere. My friend feels right at home and talks to the shopkeepers in Bengali. The shopkeepers even talk to <em>me</em> in Bengali (I just end up keep a blank face)!</p>
<h2 id="daryaganjdaryaganj"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryaganj">Daryaganj</a></h2>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="Books. More Books. And even more Books." src="http://nigelb.me/img/daryaganj.jpg"></div>
<p>The streets are filled with books. It felt like Blossoms, but on the street with no air conditioning. Overall, I found less fiction and a lot more study guides and the like. There are strategically placed ATMs all around the street, so in case you over-purchase, you can always withdraw more money. The only enemy is the heat. By the time we finished shopping, I was thoroughly exhausted and thirsty. We ate at the restaurant that claims to have invented butter chicken (Not all that much spectacular).</p>
<h2 id="old-delhiolddelhi"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Delhi">Old Delhi</a></h2>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t go back home without meeting <a href="http://twitter.com/rungta">Prateek</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/souvikdg">Souvik</a> of <a href="http://miranj.in/">Miranj</a>. We decided to go to Old Delhi on a food walk, and luckily we were all non-vegetarians. So, one Friday evening, we took the (very crowded) Yellow line to Chawri Bazar. I took a while to process the streets after getting out of the metro. Crowded streets, cycle rickshaws, and very narrow roads were the norm. To add to the &#8220;fun&#8221;, there were a bunch of bikes, honking loudly.</p>
<p>There were 6 of us and the plan was to visit 4 or 5 places, ordering food for one person at each place. We started with a place with pretty great buffalo meat. It was spicy and very juicy. We were headed to a place with Kheer next, but they&#8217;d run out! At the next stop, we ordered a full fried chicken. Then, it was a mutton curry. The last stop had beef fried rice (&#8230;heaven!).</p>
<p>After the main course, we had to have dessert. Souvik and Prateek knew a Kulfi place with a wide variety of flavors. I don&#8217;t remember all of them, but to give an idea: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_cumini">Jamun</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paan">Paan</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate">Anaar</a>. I can&#8217;t remember the other flavors, but we were fighting for a few of them :-)</p>
<p>Something I noticed while we were there was the gender ratio. There were <em>very few</em> women walking around in the streets. Probably less than 25 during the entire trip. And the streets were extremely crowded.</p>

<p>I learned recently that the Assamese New Year&#8217;s is around the same time as the Malayalam New Year and Bengali New Year. On the Sunday after the New Year, we went to an event organized by the Assam Association. I had a bit of a flashback of growing up in the middle east. There was no sitting room once the program started and everyone was enjoying being with people who spoke their language.</p>
<p>Before the event started, we had &#8220;lunch&#8221; (at 5 pm :P). It wasn&#8217;t Assamese food, but more of a generic North Eastern meal. There was pork involved (need I say more?). After we were sufficiently fed, we walked around to discover a <a href="http://www.delhievents.com/2014/04/nirbhaya-multiple-expressions-mega-art.html">Nirbhaya Multiple Expressions</a> exhibition next door. We got back just in time for the cultural programs to start. As usual, it started off a bit boring and then got better. The most fun was a dance by the little kids. They looked very adorable dancing in saris.</p>
<p>Overall, I seem to have gotten a wide range of experiences in this trip. There&#8217;s more to do and see, but then I&#8217;m incredibly lazy to step out :-)</p>

<p>When you&#8217;ve made a change against a <code>master</code> that&#8217;s moving often, you find that simply doing <code>git diff master</code> doesn&#8217;t give the right diff. It shows you the difference between your branch and current <code>master</code>. That&#8217;s not what you want in most cases. The <code>master</code> branch would have changed and now the command also shows those changes. GitHub does the right thing and the right command in this case is the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>git diff master...
</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="copying-your-changes-in-one-branch-into-another">Copying your changes in one branch into another</h2>
<p>Recently, our designer <a href="https://twitter.com/mintcanary">Sam Smith</a> started working on making <a href="https://github/ckan/ckan">CKAN</a> more responsive. <a href="https://github.com/mintcanary/ckan/tree/responsive">His Branch</a> was based off master and I wanted to make a new branch based off <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/tree/release-v2.2">release-v2.2</a> with his changes on top of it. My instinct was to make a patch.</p>
<pre>
<code>git diff master...responsive &gt; ../responsive.patch
</code>
</pre>
<p>Then, apply the patch onto a different branch. This would surely work, but I&#8217;m using a version control system! It should be smart about this. The good folks in <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23git">#git</a> pointed me in the right direction.</p>
<p>First find the last commit from the responsive branch that you <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to copy.</p>
<pre>
<code>git checkout responsive
git log master..responsive
</code>
</pre>
<p>The last commit in that log is what you <em>want</em> to copy. In this case, it&#8217;s <code>7587c6e8fe49c809ef7357b6f88496bd06ac93b9</code>, so now you want to do <code>git log 7587c6e8fe49c809ef7357b6f88496bd06ac93b9^</code>. The first commit is the one you don&#8217;t want to keep.</p>
<pre>
<code>git checkout responsive
git checkout -b reponsive-2.2
git rebase 7587c6e8fe49c809ef7357b6f88496bd06ac93b9 --onto release-2.2
</code>
</pre>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/tree/responsive-2.2">responsive-2.2</a> is a new branch with responsive changes based on top of release-v2.2!</p>

    <p>We ran with our luggage. None of the buses at ISBT were to Dharamshala. Just as we were about to give up hope, a guy said, &#8220;It&#8217;s just started from the platform and is near the gate. Run and you can catch it.&#8221; More running and I got there just as the driver was about the close the luggage doors, just in time to get our luggage in and get in. I still can&#8217;t believe we actually caught the bus. This vacation definitely started on an exciting note.</p>
<p>I woke up to scary, but beautiful mountains all around us. The fear was definitely ecause of how our driver drove the bus like a bike, squeezing into tight spots (you have a dirty mind&#8230;) band (seemingly) barely using the brakes. After we got to Dharamshala, the bus driver seemed extremely careful, because our taxi ride to Naddi, where we booked a cottage, was scarier. We did that trip several times during our stay and every single time I was convinced, we&#8217;d meet with an accident on a hairpin turn. The drivers in these mountains seem to have missed that lesson about honking on a blind curve, or at least slowing down a bit.</p>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="View from Naddi" src="http://nigelb.me/img/dharamshala-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Staying in Naddi had its downsides and upsides. We had a spectacular view and the only noise we could hear were the sparrows at the doors and the kids playing cricket in the small ground behind us. It was also a bit far from everything and we would be charged Rs. 200 to McLeodganj or Rs. 300 to Dharamshala. After we caught up with sleep on the first day, we walked around and saw the sights in Naddi. We thought about going to a waterfall nearby, but we were told it probably wasn&#8217;t worth it. We walked down to the Dal Lake instead. Now, it&#8217;s only 2 km away, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m not sure it was a good idea. We learned that we&#8217;re both not in good shape and walking downhill is actually harder. Dal lake is beautiful and quiet. We sat there for some time</p>
<strike>resting our feet and catching our breath</strike>
<p>enjoying the view.</p>
<p>The climb up and walk back to our rooms thoroughly exhausted us. The next morning, we went down to Dharamshala. After lunch, our plans were to visit the <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Infinity">Infinity Hackerspace</a>. It was quite the bus ride and then a &#8220;20 minute walk&#8221; which took us 40 minutes. The view from there is just spectacular. It looks as though the mountains are just another walk away (of course, it&#8217;s not). I spent the afternoon chatting to <code>sva</code> and <code>planemad</code> about their life there, internet woes, and renewable energy. We started heading back after an hour or two long stay there. This vacation definitely included more exercise than I get with my daily life (I think life is trying to tell me something :P).</p>
<p>The next day was our last day in Dharamshala and it was reserved for McLeodganj. We had the most physical strain on this day because we took the wrong turn to the temple and ended up going down quite a bit and climbing up an even stepper slope. But hey, we finally got there! The Tibetan museum in the complex was eye-opening to the problems of the Tibetan people and their conflicts with China. We seem to never get a clear picture of this conflict. On the way back, we did some shopping and got something to eat.</p>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="Another view from Naddi" src="http://nigelb.me/img/dharamshala-2.jpg"></div>
<p>While we were eating lunch, the sky outside was clear and it was a slightly chilly day. Right after we finished lunch, visibility outside dropped to less than 50m and suddenly the whole placed had a magical feel. Just as suddenly as it came, the clouds vanished and it was back to normal. I&#8217;ll remember that moment though, when the restaurant and the square seemed empty for 5 minutes. I couldn&#8217;t even see across the road.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable vacation. It taught me that I&#8217;m completely out of shape physically and I&#8217;ll need to do something about it :-)</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a core developer on <a href="http://ckan.net">CKAN</a> at Open Knowledge, the most widely used data catalog software. Early this year, we released version 2.2 of CKAN with a complete overhaul of the filestore. Amusingly, right after that, we started getting more and more complaints about data loss from the old filestore from on the ckan-dev list. One of the many folks, helped narrow it down to a particular file called <code>persisted_state.json</code>.</p>
<p>This file is created by a library called <code>ofs</code>. Every time a new file is added to the filestore, OFS does the following: * Read the <code>persisted_state.json</code> file. * Convert the JSON to a Python <code>dict</code>. * Add an element to this <code>dict</code> with the metadata of the new file. * Convert the <code>dict</code> back to JSON. * Write this new JSON to <code>persisted_state.json</code> file.</p>
<p>This causes concurrency problems when things were added to the filestore at high frequency and eventually lead to data loss. Oh joy.</p>
<p>Technically, this wasn&#8217;t a bug in CKAN&#8217;s codebase. We already solved the core problem at this point by switching to a new filestore which did not use ofs. We couldn&#8217;t abandon our users though and I volunteered to find a fix. I read through ofs code and I thought of solving the problem there. After an hour or two of reading up on concurrency and documentation on the python, I still didn&#8217;t have a working solution. Eventually, I asked myself what I was looking to solve.</p>
<p>My original problem: <em>&#8220;OFS is not thread-safe, causing data loss&#8221;</em>. I then realized, that&#8217;s not what I wanted to solve. A better problem to solve was: <em>&#8220;OFS is not thread-safe, causing data loss. Our users need their data.&#8221;</em>. So, I wrote a script that would re-generate the <code>persisted_state.json</code> file with just enough metadata to start working. It isn&#8217;t a complete fix, but it was a productive fix. The script was &#8220;dramatically&#8221; called <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ofs-hero">ofs-hero</a>.</p>
<p>Lesson Learnt: Defining the problem properly helps you solve it better.</p>

    <p>On January 24, I got an email from the Speakers Team at FOSSMeet asking me if I would be able to propose a talk. Fast forward to February 13th, I was on a bus heading to Kozhikode. It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve talked a conference and this would be the first I&#8217;d talk about <a href="http://funnel.fossmeet.in/2014/75-open-data-why-you-should-care">open data</a>. Despite being a Malayali, I&#8217;d actually not met a lot of members of the FOSS community from Kerala. As usual, I enjoyed meeting and talking to people about their work and what they do (yes, I&#8217;m still an introvert :D).</p>
<p>On the first day, I attended Praveen&#8217;s talk (fine, not talk, a discussion) about privacy. Rather fierce arguments broke about privacy, specifically whether the government should invade it to save lives. I&#8217;m fairly certain it got a lot of people thinking about privacy. It&#8217;s hard to think about things like privacy unless you can contextualize it for yourself and that&#8217;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>After lunch, I sat in the session about Anoop&#8217;s workshop about contributing to Open Source. It was meant to give people an idea of the tools you should know. I only sat in it for an hour or so and they were learning git at that time. A while later, I stepped out, primarily because I was starting to get sleepy.</p>
<div class="blog-image" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="FOSSMeet 2014" src="http://nigelb.me/img/fossmeet-14.jpg"></div>
<p>I got back to the main auditorium, just in time to learn that a student passed away on the campus, in the grounds we could see from the auditorium. A wall fell down and he was stuck under it. All of attendees were asked to be in one of the lecture halls while the organizers talked to the faculty and figure out what next. The organizers decided to cancel all the entertainment activities that were planned and the hack night. The remaining sessions were held as an informal discussion rather than actual talks. Later that night, the events of next day were also canceled.</p>
<p>My talk had a few people and we had good conversation about open data and thanks to Nirbheek, we had people glance at <a href="http://theballot.in">The Ballot</a>. I couldn&#8217;t give the talk I planned, but I&#8217;m grateful for the discussions we had. Later that day, the students were leading a protest in front of the director&#8217;s house and the rest of the event was formally canceled.</p>
<p>FOSSMeet seems to be a wonderful place to get more students aware of free and open source and kickstarting contributions. The organizers had done a good job, but were just unlucky with the turn of events. Now that I&#8217;ve attended FOSSMeet once, I&#8217;m planning on attending the next editions for sure.</p>

    <p>When I boot an Ubuntu virtual machine with Vagrant and install PostgreSQL, I&#8217;m getting <code>LATIN1</code> encoding:</p>
<pre>
<code>vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo -u postgres psql -l
                            List of databases
Name      | Owner    | Encoding | Collate | Ctype | Access privileges
----------+----------+----------+---------+-------+------------------
postgres  | postgres | LATIN1   | en_US   | en_US |
template0 | postgres | LATIN1   | en_US   | en_US | =c/postgres
template1 | postgres | LATIN1   | en_US   | en_US | =c/postgres
(3 rows)
</code>
</pre>
<p>I found a solution via the <a href="http://blog.crowdint.com/2011/08/11/postgresql-in-vagrant.html">Crowd Interactive Tech Blog</a>:</p>
<pre>
<code>vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc

# Add these lines to the bottom of the file:
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
</code>
</pre>
<p>Disconnect from your virtual machine (ctrl-d) then connect again (<code>vagrant ssh</code>), then drop and recreate your database cluster (this will delete the contents of your database!):</p>
<pre>
<code>vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo pg_dropcluster 9.1 --stop
vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo pg_createcluster 9.1 main --start
vagrant@precise64&gt; sudo su
</code>
</pre>
<p>If you reconfigure the locales before creating your database, you don&#8217;t have to do this. <code>sudo -u postgres psql -l</code> should now report <code>UTF8</code> encoding.</p>
<p>You can package up the fixed vagrant box so you don&#8217;t have to do this again:</p>
<pre>
<code>host&gt; vagrant halt
host&gt; vagrant package
host&gt; vagrant box add precise64-with-postgresql-fixed package.box
</code>

    <p>Lion is the latest version of OS X that my old MacBook will run, I don&#8217;t know if the following applies to later versions as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few things that can go wrong when trying to make an encrypted Lion clone with <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you just format your external drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled), then the clone will work fine but it won&#8217;t be encrypted, even if you have FileVault encryption on your internal drive (FileVault&#8217;s full-disk encryption in Lion is transparent to apps like SuperDuper).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first time I tried to make an encrypted clone, I made a two partition layout on the external drive and encrypted and cloned to one of the partitions. My MacBook failed to boot from the encrypted partition (it gave me the circle with a diagonal line through it). Maybe I did something wrong, or maybe SuperDuper clones to encrypted partitions are not bootable with multi-partition drive layouts. (Clones to unencrypted partitions on multi-partition drives work fine.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next time I used SuperDuper&#8217;s smart update to do the first copy, again the MacBook failed to boot from the clone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the process that eventually worked for me, using SuperDuper 2.7.2 (v92) on OS X 10.7.5:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Disk Utility to create a single, Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) partition filling your entire external drive.</li>
<li>Use SuperDuper to clone your internal drive to your external, using the erase then copy method to do the first copy.</li>
<li>Now test it: shut down your mac, remove your internal drive, connect your external drive and turn on your mac. It should boot from your external drive, asking you for the drive password to decrypt it during boot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This confirms that even if your internal drive completely dies, you can boot your mac from your clone. It&#8217;s not relying on any kind of boot or recovery partition or encryption keys stored somewhere on the internal drive. (To boot from your clone without removing your internal drive first: shut down the mac, then hold down the option key and turn it on, keep the option key held down until it offers you a choice of drives to boot from.)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it, but it should be possible to boot the clone and use SuperDuper to restore your OS X system to a new, blank internal drive or even to another mac.</p>
<p>You can now shut down your mac, put your internal drive back in, boot from it, and then connect your external drive and update your clone using SuperDuper&#8217;s smart update, and the clone will continue to be bootable.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on the <em>Email</em> button it opens a Persona sign in page in a popup window. After signing into Persona (which can usually be done with just a mouse-click, if you&#8217;ve already registered your email address with Persona), the popup window disappears and the user is taken back to CKAN and logged in.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of the login process:</p>
<p>This was quite a fun plugin to develop, it was one of the first plugins to use <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html#ckan.plugins.interfaces.IAuthenticator">CKAN&#8217;s IAuthenticator plugin interface</a> and it revealed some interesting limitations that could be addressed in CKAN.</p>
<p>The way it works is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user clicks on the <em>Email</em> button in CKAN, and is taken to the Persona sign-in page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user signs in to Persona using their email address, verifying that they are the owner of the email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persona sends an identity assertion certificate to CKAN, asserting that the users owns the email address. Some JavaScript belonging to the Persona plugin receives this assertion from Persona and posts it to CKAN&#8217;s login URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now in the CKAN Python code on the server, when something is posted to the login URL CKAN iterates over the active IAuthenticator plugins and calls the <code>login()</code> method of each, to see if any of them can handle this login. If no plugin logs in the user, CKAN will fall back to its default username and password login handler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Persona plugin&#8217;s <code>login()</code> method receives the assertion from Persona and verifies it. If the assertion verifies, then the plugin searches for an existing CKAN user who has the verified email address. At this point, there are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is one existing CKAN user with the email address, and the plugin simply logs the user into this account. (This is what&#8217;s shown in the video above.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no existing user with the email address, so the plugin creates a new account with this email address and logs the user into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are multiple existing users with the email address (email addresses aren&#8217;t unique in CKAN). In this case the plugin shows the user a list of the user accounts and asks them to choose which one they want to login to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the user account to be logged into has been identified or created, the plugin saves the email address and username in CKAN&#8217;s Beaker session and redirects the browser to CKAN&#8217;s user dashboard page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On every page load, CKAN calls the <code>identify()</code> method of every active IAuthenticator plugin to see if any of them can find out which user is logged in. If no plugin identifies the logged-in user, CKAN searches for a cookie created by its default username and password login.</p>
<p>The Persona plugin&#8217;s <code>identify()</code> method will use the cookie it saved in the previous step to identify the user. This is how the user stays logged-in as they move from page to page on the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, when the user hits the logout button CKAN calls the Persona plugin&#8217;s <code>logout()</code> method, which deletes the cookie that the plugin created so that its <code>identify()</code> method will no longer find a logged-in user when the next page is loaded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A few of things still need to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When creating new user accounts, the Persona plugin has to generate a user name. Currently it just uses a UUID, and the user can change their name in CKAN once they&#8217;re logged in.</p>
<p>A nicer solution would be to generate a username based on the email address. <code>bob@gmail.com</code> would get the username <code>bob</code>, of if <code>bob</code> is already taken then something like <code>bob54</code> (random number appended).</p>
<p>Before being logged in the user should be taken to a <em>Choose your username</em> form where they can enter the username they want, and the form is pre-filled with the generated username as a suggestion.</p>
<p>When the user enters a username into this form and submits it, it needs to be checked to make sure that it&#8217;s a valid and untaken username, and then the user account can be created and the user logged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When creating new user accounts, the Persona plugin also has to generate a password, because CKAN currently requires a password for the new account. This password is never shown to the user so they can&#8217;t use it to login using the traditional username and password route. They can only login using Persona. The generated password is nothing but a potential security issue.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed in CKAN by allowing user accounts without passwords, that cannot be logged into the traditional way. See the issue here: <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/1459">https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/1459</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging in when there are multiple user accounts with the same email address isn&#8217;t implemented yet (CKAN just crashes). This feature will actually probably be quite handy when done, e.g. for developers who have multiple accounts on the same site for testing (a normal account, a sysadmin account, etc).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that still need to be done include JavaScript-less login with Persona, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/Security_Considerations">CSRF protection</a>, tests, a nicer user experience when the Persona verification fails, and enabling CKAN accounts to have multiple email addresses and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/The_implementor_s_guide/Adding_extra_email_addresses_with_Persona">verifying those addresses with Persona</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/The_implementor_s_guide/Testing?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=Persona%2FThe_implementor_s_guide%2FTesting">Mozilla recommend using Selenium</a> to test logging in with Persona. We&#8217;ve been planning to use Selenium for new frontend tests in CKAN, so once we get going with that maybe we can write the ckanext-persona tests in the same way.</p>
<p>To test ckanext-persona, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/The_implementor_s_guide/Adding_extra_email_addresses_with_Persona">ckanext-persona website</a> for installation instructions.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m sitting in the lobby of <a href="http://www.clinkhostels.com/">Clink 261</a>, a hostel near King&#8217;s Cross, hearing so many languages that my brain hurts trying to identify them (Nope, I can&#8217;t). To complicate matters, the reduced sunshine is confusing. The week has consisted of meetings, plotting (to take over the world, of course), drinks, ranting, and generally fun things. It&#8217;s been a tiring but spectacular week with my team at the <a href="http://okfn.org">OKF</a>. As a remote employee, I enjoy meeting my colleagues in person and spending time together.</p>
<p>As always, my trips are more about people than places. In Cambridge, once I was properly awake, I met a colleague for lunch at <a href="http://www.the-cambridgeblue.co.uk/">Cambridge Blue</a>, where we had deer pie for lunch. My Twitter followers seemed a bit mad that I ate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi">Bambi</a>. From there, we went to his friends&#8217; and had tea with them, while enjoying watching their kids play and chatting about books, trains, and comics. Later in the evening, I caught up with an old roommate and his family.</p>
<p>I walked everywhere in Cambridge except when I had luggage or if I was, <em>cough</em>, otherwise unable to walk. Our hotel was a 40-minute walk away from the venue of our meetings. I took a taxi on a few mornings, but when I could, I walked. The cold manages to wake me up, and in a few minutes, I&#8217;m nice and warm (weather hacking?!). There are other advantages too, like a lovely pastry shop on way ;)</p>
<p>I spent 3 days with my <a href="http://okfn.org/about/team/#services-unit">team</a> plotting to take over the world with <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> and then 2 days with the rest of the team. An extremely produtive time during the day and a good time chatting with everyone afterward, especially people from other teams. We had a &#8220;Cheese Off&#8221;, which France won, closely followed by Brazil. The close of the summit involved a puppy and cake!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in London now, taking a day off for myself. I might head out and grab some lunch or take a walk. No plans for today and I&#8217;m leaving it that way.</p>

    <p>Today I learned something about Ansible debugging from <code>benno</code> on #ansible. Occasionally, commands can get stuck, especially if it&#8217;s waiting for input. You can&#8217;t fix this until you recognize what&#8217;s going on and see the prompt. In other words, you want to see the stdout and stderr on the target machine. Here&#8217;s what you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run ansible with <code>-vvv</code>.</li>
<li>Login to the remote host where the command is being executed.</li>
<li>Find the ansible process executing the command and kill them.</li>
<li>The stdout and stderr should be printed to the console where ansible was running.</li>

    <p>2013 has been good fun and terrible, at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moved to my own apartment. I&#8217;ve been longing to do this for ages. An apartment with a wall full of books. I think I&#8217;ve managed to achieve that ;)</li>
<li>Cooked for myself for nearly most of the year. There were occasions where I burned food, but it&#8217;s overall been a joyful experience.</li>
<li>Last year involved quite a bit of travel: 3 trips to London, a trip to San Francisco, and a trip to Kenya.</li>
<li>Met lots of people I&#8217;ve wanted to meet for ages. The Mozilla summit and the London trips helped particularly.</li>
<li>I bought a Kobo in 2013 and according to it, I&#8217;ve read 37 books. I don&#8217;t even know how many physical books I&#8217;ve read.</li>
<li>Work has been great with nearly 100 commits on CKAN. Lots of new features and bug fixes on which I&#8217;ve taken the initiative. I say this constantly, but I&#8217;ll reiterate: I work with the most amazing people.</li>
<li>Usually, I&#8217;m shy and not very talkative. I started with meeting people I know but hadn&#8217;t met, to meeting completely new people.</li>
<li>Writing. My blog was mostly ignored since end of 2012. Managed to pick it up and I wrote 15 posts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Health-wise, 2013 has been an absolute disaster. I&#8217;ve been admitted to the hospital at least 3 times. As I write this, I have a cough from a throat infection. <em>Sigh</em>.</li>
<li>The sedentary lifestyle has affected my overall fitness, Instead of losing weight, I&#8217;ve gained weight. Staying at my parents&#8217; for 2 months probably contributed to it as well.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that I like writing, I couldn&#8217;t even start NaNoWriMo.</li>
<li>Frontend development. Still ashamed of my skills with Javascript and CSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I read this post I read, I read Sean Ogle&#8217;s excellent post about <a href="http://www.seanogle.com/lifestyle-design/new-years-2014">resolutions</a>. With that in mind, I&#8217;ve set some for 2014. I&#8217;m going to be tracking them month-by-month and posting updates every quarter (I even have calender reminders!).</p>
<h2 id="section">2014</h2>
<ul>
<li>An exercise habit, tracked by number of days in a month I did not exercise.</li>
<li>Learn to write C. I&#8217;m going to work through <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn C the Hard Way</a> which has 52 exercise and seems perfect for a year-long project.</li>
<li>Read more non-fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed the non-fiction books I read last year (<a href="http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/">Quiet</a> by Susan Cain and <a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Bad Science</a> by Dr. Ben Goldacre. I recommend them both!). My goal is to read 6 non-fiction books by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Write! Blog posts or perhaps a short story. I still don&#8217;t have a particularly good idea about writing a book, but sitting down and writing a book, even if it&#8217;s terrible, seems like a good way to start getting better.</li>
<li>JavaScript. We have a complicated relationship that needs to be sorted out ;)</li>
<li>Cut down on the unnecessary from my online life. I started this by the end of 2013 and this is going to continue into 2014. I&#8217;ve been deleting accounts from sites I don&#8217;t use anymore, killing servers that I pay for but don&#8217;t use, cutting down IRC channels significantly (went from 150 channels to 35), and more.</li>

  <div style="max-width:43em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; overflow:hidden;">
    <p>Last week this time, I was packing for a trip to Nairobi, Kenya. The preparations for this trip started 2 weeks ago with a Yellow Fever shot. You need the shot and the WHO&#8217;s International Certificate of Vaccination if you want to get in and out of the country. If you ever need one in Cochin, the place to go is Port Health Organization. They do it twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays starting from 10:00. They only give 100 shots a day, so be there a bit early.</p>
<p>It was a work trip and our client booked my tickets. My flights were booked via DOH and I was to fly out of COK at 04:25. Kenya has visa on arrival for Indian citizens. On all the trips I&#8217;ve been on so far, I&#8217;ve had a visa before traveling. When I got to the check-in counter, the lady didn&#8217;t know which country Nairobi was in. I guess there isn&#8217;t a lot of Indians traveling to Kenya. I had to explain that Kenya has visa on arrival for Indians and all I would need was 50 USD and Yellow Fever shots. She took a few minutes to confirm that and finally handed me my boarding pass. When I went to the Immigration counter, I had to go through the exact same process again. It made me smile :)</p>
<p>The Cochin airport seems to have had a lot of renovation from the last time I flew through here (well, that was 9.5 years ago). The flights were okay, except I got the middle seat on the flight to Nairobi. All my worries about the immigration process was unnecessary. It was an extremely quick process. There were forms to fill up when we landed and I think I missed one. The customs officer asked me for a particular form, when I didn&#8217;t have it, he just waved me through.</p>
<div class="blog-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduardozarate/3513925828/" title="Nairobi, Kenya by Eduardo Z&#225;rate on Flickr"><img alt="Nairobi, Kenya by Eduardo Z&#225;rate on Flickr" src="http://nigelb.me/img/nairobi-city.jpg"></a></div>
<p>As soon as I got out of the airport, I found a representative from the taxi company who were to take me to the ILRI campus. I had an extremely friendly driver and he pointed out places of interest along our route. When we got to the campus, I was taken away by how pretty it looked! After spending about 9 hours in planes and 4 hours in airports, I was exhausted and wanted to crash as soon as I got to my room. My hunger won out the exhaustion, I walked to the bar on campus, which doubles up as the restaurant in the evening. There were a few people already there watching a football match and I became friends with them quickly. We were talking about cricket as I ate dinner.</p>
<div class="blog-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilri/4000481531/in/set-72157622561326392" title="Hostel blocks by ILRI on Flickr"><img alt="Hostel blocks by ILRI on Flickr" src="http://nigelb.me/img/ilri_hostels.jpg"></a></div>
<p>The next morning, I woke to the sound of rain. It was raining pretty hard and it was cold, surprising after the hot afternoon the previous day. Managed to find breakfast and I met my contact who guided me to the conference room where I&#8217;d spend most of my afternoons for the next 5 days. I&#8217;ve never done a training before and I&#8217;m not very confident about my public speaking skills. Over the course of the week, I got more confident and more friendly with the team I&#8217;d been training. We were joking around and they were helping each other by the end of the 5 days which nearly brought a tear of happiness to my eyes. Oh, a note of warning. If you ever have to train people all day, remember, it&#8217;s a very exhausting experience.</p>
<div class="blog-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilri/4000483825/in/set-72157622561326392" title="Mara House by ILRI on Flickr"><img alt="Mara House by ILRI on Flickr" src="http://nigelb.me/img/ilri_mara_house.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Every evening was spent at the bar, having dinner, and sometimes a glass of wine. I took my Kobo to the bar, and amusingly, I was reading Quiet by Susan Cain, a book about introversion. I became good friends with everyone as the days went on and had interesting conversations. We talked about African politics, Swahili, research, and a few more things which I should probably not mention for the privacy of the people involved ;-) Kenya celebrated their 50th Independence day while I was there. The night before Independence day, the bar was extremely busy and I happened to sit next to the Director General of the institute. He was friendly and we had a nice chat about the Caribbeans. Later, he bought the house and drink and we had a big cheer for Kenya!</p>
<p>The week went by quickly and I was sad when Friday arrived. My biggest regret is not having had a chance to spend some time outside of the campus. I&#8217;ll leave that for next time. Yes, there will one, a personal one :)</p>
<p>And the other regret is that I didn&#8217;t take a camera.</p>

    <p>There already have been several excellent blog posts about the Summit. I want to talk about the biggest opportunity that the Summit provided &#8211; in-person connections. I&#8217;ve been involved with Mozilla since 2011 and this is the third Mozilla event I&#8217;ve attended. Compared to the previous events, Mozilla Summit 2013 was a sensory overload, in a pleasant way of course.</p>

On Friday evening, after the Firefox OS dinner, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/morgamic" title="Morgamic on Twitter">morgamic</a> for the first time! It was definitely an exciting moment for me. Later, philikon was talking to morgamic and he looked familiar. I asked him his IRC nick name and I had an Aha! moment.

<p>Note: If I haven&#8217;t mentioned your name, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve forgotten it. These few weeks have been a bit stressful and it&#8217;s been more then 2 months since the Summit.</p>

    <p>At some point last month, I was a bit excited about writing a novel for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>. However, <a href="http://nigelb.me/2013-11-13-hello-again-hospital.html">my health</a> from the start of this month hasn&#8217;t been great, sadly. On the one hand, I love the idea of writing, it definitely improves my mood in general. I was pretty sure I&#8217;d suck at it, but I wanted to give it a try. On the other hand, at the start of the month, I&#8217;d just gotten out of the hospital. I was just getting back to normal energy levels when I got in the hospital again. It&#8217;s the 16th today, and I&#8217;ve written 10 words. At this point, I&#8217;ll admit failure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m only admitting failure for the goal of writing 50K in November. I will still try to write a 50K novel. Or write 50K words of blog posts in a month inspired by <a href="http://therealkatie.net/blog/2013/oct/28/nanoblogmo/">Katie</a>.</p>

    <p>I seem to be having a not-so-good time health-wise. First, I decided to celebrate getting paid by ordering a pizza last month. My body doesn&#8217;t seem to like unhealthy food, because I was throwing up the next morning. I tried to drink water and have an anti-vomit tablet, but that didn&#8217;t help. When I got to the point where I couldn&#8217;t keep down water, I had my friends take me to the hospital. The doctor in the Casuality gave me an injection and started me on IV fluids. I think I slept for some time and when I woke up, I threw up again. At this point, the doctor asked me if I wanted to be admitted overnight and I agreed it was a good idea.</p>
<p>By morning, I finally stopped throwing up. The doctor wanted to keep me for a few days because my creatinine levels were a little high and kept increasing. At that moment, to be honest, I didn&#8217;t understand the seriousness of what was happening. When I asked him if he&#8217;d let me go that evening, he said my kidneys weren&#8217;t functioning well and until that became normal, he wouldn&#8217;t send me home. I ended up staying from Wednesday evening until Monday evening, getting lots of IV fluids and drinking lots of water. The final diagnosis was that I was extremely dehydrated and this affected my kidney function briefly. When I was discharged, my doctor said I was very lucky to avoid dialysis. That&#8217;s when I understood the seriousness of what happened.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elentir/4504031924/"><img alt="Hospital de la Cruz Roja de Vigo" src="http://nigelb.me/img/hospital.jpg"></a></div>
<p>The next day, I flew to Kerala to spend some time with parents so I didn&#8217;t have to cook for a few days and my parents would have some relief on seeing me. That&#8217;s when the second incident happened &#8211; I had a seizure, for the first time that I know of. I don&#8217;t remember much of Wednesday except turning off the alarm. When they got me to the hospital, they gave me enough injections that I was out until evening. I woke up around 7:30 pm in the Neurology and Stroke ICU. I had brief memories of being near the MRI machine, my aunt standing at the edge of my bed, and another aunt telling me something. I didn&#8217;t even realize I was in the ICU until the patient in the bed next to me told me.</p>
<p>Later, my dad came and talked to me. That&#8217;s when I understood what happened. I was under observation for one night and I was, to be honest, extremely bored. The nurses in the ICU were friendly, but most patients were sedated so I could just look around and watch them work. I stayed in the hospital from Wednesday until Saturday this time. After all the tests, the neurologist advised me to take more rest and stress less, and I was otherwise okay. Sigh. If you don&#8217;t see me around like you used to, now you know why :)</p>

    <p>I cannot believe how quickly time has passed! Two trips to Cambridge for the summit, 100+ commits on CKAN and CKAN extensions, contributions to PyBossa, OpenSpending and satellite sites, and innumerable GIFs later &#8211; I&#8217;ve finished a year at the <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>!</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/JxPvifPKoBTKE/"><img alt="success!" src="http://nigelb.me/img/success.gif"></a></div>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem like time has passed at all. I remember the first call I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/rufuspollock">Rufus</a> and making the <a href="http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/">Salary Converter</a>. Among all the interviews I&#8217;ve had, interviewing at OKF is definitely among the top 3.</p>
<p>In the last year, I&#8217;ve learned a lot about working remotely and I&#8217;m now in love with being a remotee. Managing time better is also something I&#8217;ve become far better at than I used to. I&#8217;ve discovered that my best time for productive coding is 6 am to 12 pm. Any day that I start at 6 am is bound to be a very productive one; starting later makes me struggle to be productive.</p>
<p>The two trips to Cambridge have been a lot of fun &#8211; meeting my colleagues and planning for the 6 months ahead. Plus, it&#8217;s the one time I get to actually grab a drink with my team!</p>
<p>On the programming side, the biggest learning has been handling testing better. Thanks to my team, I&#8217;ve learned to write new tests and fix the ones I break, though I occasionally run into &#8220;how did these tests ever pass&#8221; kind of tests though, leading to a fun day of debugging. I&#8217;ve also volunteered to own projects in our team that&#8217;s leaning towards operations. This has given me a chance to work with <a href="http://ansibleworks.com">Ansible</a> and refresh my packaging experience.</p>
<p>Ever since I&#8217;ve started working as a programmer, OKF is the first time I&#8217;ve stayed on for a year, and I have to give full credit to my amazing colleagues who&#8217;ve made waking up to work fun!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been a little tensed about my upcoming travel to Santa Clara for the <a href="http://summit.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Summit</a> in October, because the last time I applied for a US visa, my application was denied. Today, my visa application was granted! I&#8217;ll be in Santa Clara in October and I hope to meet my mozillian friends as well other friends who live in SF (<em>looks in the direction of <a href="http://princessleia.com">pleia2</a></em>).</p>

<p>Yesterday night, I spent about 20 minutes indexing all my documents neatly with Post-Its and sorting them by the order they might be asked. The visa officer didn&#8217;t ask to see any documents. He asked me about my travel, why I was traveling, who was paying for it, why Mozilla was paying for it, about my current job and salary, and if I&#8217;ve traveled out of the country before. At the end of it, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re done. Have a good trip.&#8221; It took me a while to get past the shock, but yay! It&#8217;s going to be great fun and I look forward to hanging out with everyone :-)</p>

    <p>Finally, I made it to a Pycon India! The last 2 years, I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/nigelbabu#ref1">pulling a sankarshan</a>. I walked in just in time for <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz">Kenneth Reitz&#8217;</a> keynote. Kenneth talked about writing an API from his experience in writing and maintaining <a href="http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">requests</a>. There was good deal of information about coding practices, managing contributors, and avoiding burnout. Key things I remember: Documentation, documentation (yes, I&#8217;m repeating it again, because it&#8217;s important!), clean APIs, extendability, and learning to say no (without being a dick).</p>
<p>A conference is not just about the content, it is also a great opportunity to catch with people I&#8217;ve known online and don&#8217;t meet that often. For instance, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/haseeb_offline">haseeb</a> at the registration counter. Later, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/runa_b">Runa</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sankarshan">Sankarshan</a>. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve met Runa since <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/confkdein/">conf.kde.in</a> in 2011! And I hadn&#8217;t met Sankarshan at all. Other usual suspects include <a href="http://kushaldas.in/">Kushal Das</a>, who I&#8217;m glad to report did not have any sort of untoward accident (and I hope I didn&#8217;t jinx it), <a href="http://souvikdasgupta.com/">Souvik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/snehapriscilla">Sneha</a>, <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in/">Noufal</a>, Devi, <a href="http://anandology.com/">Anand</a>, Ramki, <a href="https://twitter.com/vivekvc">Vivek</a> and so many more people that I can&#8217;t even remember all their names!</p>
<p>As is usual, I spent more time in hallway conversations than in actual sessions. After the keynote, I sat in two sessions, the first one was <a href="http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2013/82-applications-of-python-in-robotics">Applications of Python in Robotics</a> by Lentin Joseph. He actually had a robot on the table when he was presenting which got me hooked on to the talk. I don&#8217;t have a lot of experience in hardware, so all the information was a little dry for me. Lentin did a demo at a conference AND IT WORKED! Well, sort of. The robot tracked the yellow ball and moved (albiet slowly, because the table cloth didn&#8217;t offer a lot of traction).</p>
<p>The other interesting session was <a href="http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2013/70-lets-talk-testing-with-selenium">Let&#8217;s talk testing with Selenium</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/anisha_narang">Anisha</a>. I&#8217;ve known the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium project</a> ever since I started contributing to Mozilla, though, I haven&#8217;t actually used it. Anisha&#8217;s session was information packed and made it look easy as well. In the coming weeks, I&#8217;m going to take a look at it to see how I can use it at the <a href="http://okfn.org/">day job</a>.</p>
<p>Before I left Pycon, I was convinced to join the PSSI (Python Software Society of India), though I couldn&#8217;t stay for the AGM.</p>
<p>Ah, I forgot to mention that hanging out with friends in town for Pycon started on Friday evening. I met, among others, Sengupta and Harshad of <a href="https://www.instamojo.com/">Instamojo</a> (they&#8217;re hiring btw, if you&#8217;re into python, get in touch with them!), Jaidev, Parth, Bala, and Nivedita. We met at Egg Factory and we were chatting and making <a href="https://github.com/sengupta/twss">twss</a> jokes.</p>
<p>Overall, Pycon 2013 was a great conference and I look forward to many more years of attending it :)</p>

    <p>I finally have a few weeks where I haven&#8217;t visited the hospital (<em>knocks on wood</em>) and it&#8217;s probably safe to write about it. It&#8217;s been an interesting few weeks after I got back from London. My sleep cycle hadn&#8217;t quite reset back to normal. I was going to bed pretty late and waking up late, whereas I&#8217;m notoriously a morning person.</p>
<h3 id="visit-1">Visit 1</h3>
<p>I went to bed quite late Sunday (July 21st) and woke up quite late too. As soon as I woke up, I threw up. I&#8217;ve always been taught that vomiting is dehydrating and I should drink water. I felt extremely weak anyway, and I had water mixed with glucose powder. A while later, I woke up and threw up again. This kept happening throughout the day, I&#8217;d drink water, lie down, and a few hours later, I&#8217;d throw it up.</p>
<p>Around evening, I went to the nearest medical store and got an anti-vomit. That didn&#8217;t seem to help, so my friends (Thanks <a href="http://pratul.in/">lut4rp</a> and <a href="http://ankursethi.in/">GnrlMxms</a>!) got me to the nearest hospital. The doctor in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department">Casualty</a> got me on IV fluids and gave me an injection. They also checked my BP and temperature. Turns out I had a fever of 102 F, and my BP was low. Somehow during all the mess of throwing up, I hadn&#8217;t noticed that I was feverish.</p>
<p>The doctor gave me the option of being admitted or going home after the IV fluids was done with medicines for a few days. Since I live alone, I preferred to stay at the hospital. A few days that involved lots of IV fluids, and blood and urine tests later, I was discharged on Thursday. Seems to have been just a viral fever.</p>

<p>A few days at the hospital really did sap my energy. I didn&#8217;t feel like cooking or eating really, so I decided to visit my parents for a few days and work out of there. I should describe my setup, which is pretty relevant to what happened - My laptop is an HP, which is mostly plastic. It sits on a stand that&#8217;s also plastic. This whole setup was on a metal table, which was in fact my old study table. And I use a wireless keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>I missed work for large parts of July because of being sick and my hard-disk dying while in Cambridge. On August 1st, I woke up bright and early at 6:30 (okay, that&#8217;s late for me to be honest). I talked to my mom for a bit and booted up my laptop. I remember sitting down on my chair waiting for it to boot up. My next memory is right outside the Casualty at the local hospital in a car and my mom asking me to get out of the car into the wheelchair.</p>
<p>I was very confused. My body hurt and I had no idea what the hell happened. When the doctor comes around my mom tells him I got electrocuted. I&#8217;m lying on the bed going, WTF. I was hooked up to the ECG and I had a catheter placed and IV fluids again. I <em>think</em> I was given an injection at this point.</p>
<p>My parents later told me, they heard the chair move and what sounded like me throwing up. When my dad came to check on me, I was on the floor, shaking (my leg was still touching the table). My dad switched off the power and called my mom. I&#8217;m told my mom screamed so loudly that our neighbors came running. One of our our neighbors gave me chest compressions and helped carry me to their car. I have no memory of all of this. The one vague memory I have is throwing up. But I felt like that was part of a dream, and we were going on a trip somewhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the hospital, a more senior doctor looked at me. He said I looked fine, my vitals were normal, and he&#8217;d let me go after the IV fluids were over. They disconnected my ECG and wheeled me to a different bed. Later, I learned, I was part of the area that&#8217;s reserved for the most serious patients (<em>gulp</em>). It had an ECG and oxygen supply right there. There were only 3 beds like that and I was in one of them.</p>
<p>The doctor did let me go after the bottle of IV fluids was over, with pain meds to take if I needed them. I escaped with a scratch on my finger and my neck hurting for a few hours.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>, it&#8217;s been a fun few weeks&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: I was in the hospital twice in two weeks, once for viral fever, and then because I got electrocuted.</strong></p>

    <p>I always rage at rubygems. Every time I setup my OS, I forget that it doesn&#8217;t tell me what it&#8217;s up to and tries to install globally by default. Here&#8217;s how I fix it usually. I create a <code>.gemrc</code> file in my home directory with the following content</p>
<p><code>gem: --user-install -V</code></p>
<p>And then add <code>$HOME/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/</code> to my <code>$PATH</code>. I had to go looking for this right now because I wanted to write another blog post and then I discovered Jekyll wasn&#8217;t installed. Sigh. Typical.</p>

    <p>A site I've been working on for the past few months has just launched. <a href="http://data.gc.ca">data.gc.ca "2.0"</a> is a completely rewritten version of the Open Data portal for the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>I worked on the <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> portion of the site responsible for the data catalogue. CKAN is an open source Data Portal application written in Python. I built a fully bilingual schema with many additional fields for our datasets. I also optimized, fixed and improved many parts of CKAN itself.</p>
<p>Our team built templates based on the <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew">Web Experience Toolkit (WET)</a>. WET provides building blocks for creating accessible, mobile-friendly web sites. These templates include a <a href="http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/a15a3c83-d94f-4709-94a0-f60cd7d0bfa1">map widget for our geospatial datasets</a> and an <a href="http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/1d51b4cd-e698-4a58-877c-b586c7e80205/resource/2826ad2a-a99e-4fc1-8825-746381aa244a">interactive data table</a> for previews of tabular data.</p>
<p>All of our work is available on the <a href="https://github.com/open-data/">open-data github page</a> and is released under a permissive license.</p>
<p>data.gc.ca might just be the largest, most fully bilingual and most accessible CKAN site anywhere. More to come!</p>

    <p>Centre for Internet and Society <a href="http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/events/celebrating-5-years-of-cis">celebrated</a> their 5-year anniversary with an exhibition at their Bangalore and Delhi offices and a series of talks in Bangalore. I was there on Tuesday and managed to spend some time at the exhibition and attend the talks.</p>
<p>The exhibition showed off some of the work that CIS has been doing and the work of several independent artists. The bits that are particularly in my memory is Tara Kelton&#8217;s work as well as Sharath&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Lawrence Liang talked about the Encyclopedia of Indian cinema. It was a very interesting talk, especially for me since it encompasses open data, open source software, and copyright issues! A convergence of a lot of my interests :) Lawrence talked about what they&#8217;ve built and the problems they&#8217;ve faced and how internet as a medium for a film encyclopedia is very powerful, but is limited by the legal issues surrounding copyright laws.</p>

    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> All the problems I had with the money transfer is now solved!</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve given my employers details to directly transfer money into my account. The money is deposited without needing me to fill up a form. So, I guess they were being all formal when it was sent to their intermediary account.</p>
<p>Our best guess at this point is that the intermediary bank were missing out on details all the time. And then my bank would have to ask them for more details and then they would send an addendum with the clarification. Meh. Problems solved. Twice I&#8217;ve recieved direct transfers to my account and both times I got at the end of the second working day!</p>

    <p>I've spent a lot of time with <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> this past year working on updating and improving the <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/docs/">Urwid documentation</a>. I've found writing documentation is a really hard but also really important and rewarding part of my programming work.</p>
<p><em>update 2013-10-14</em>: <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/category/1/wtd-2013">videos posted here</a></p>
<p>Notable talks: <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/13/integrating-development-documentation-and-report">Integrating Development, Documentation and Reporting</a>, <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/19/getting-developers-and-engineers-to-write-the-doc">Getting Developers and Engineers to Write the Docs</a>, <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/1/how-mozilla-supports-users-all-over-the-world">How Mozilla supports users all over the world</a>, <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/16/typography-for-docs">Typography for Docs</a>, <a href="http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/23/write-tighter">Write Tight(er)</a></p>
<p>At this conference I learned lots of things I'm doing wrong. Dark borders on my <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/docs/">urwid docs</a> detract from the most important thing: the content. I should be limiting the number of characters per line.</p>
<p>I liked the suggestion that a <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions">FAQ is a list of bugs</a>. If people really are asking these questions all the time, why not fix the software?</p>
<p>I also learned a lot about writing in general, and had lots of fun. I couldn't get used to some people saying just "doc" (without the s) for documentation, however.<br clear="right"></p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve always had a phobia of banks. They kept making me think of a teacher waiting to punish me because I wrote something wrong in one of their precious forms. When I was younger, I had terrible stage fright, that&#8217;s pretty much what happens to me every time I have to deal with a bank.</p>
<h2 id="first-payment">First Payment</h2>
<p>Ever since I started working at <a href="http://okfn.org">OKF</a>, I&#8217;ve had trouble with my bank, Axis Bank. I&#8217;ve received Wire Transfers to my account several times in the past, and never had to do anything. But for some reason this time, I ran into trouble. Axis bank promises &#8220;<a href="http://www.axisbank.com/nri/others/remitance/wire-transfer/wire-transfer.aspx">Direct Credit to your Axis account in less than 48 hours</a>&#8221; . I&#8217;m, of course, willing to give a leeway of 48 hours more. But the last for 3 times, it&#8217;s taken 12 days. Transfers are made out on 10th every month and I receive them on 22nd. This was true for both December and January.</p>
<p>The first payment at OKF wasn&#8217;t released into my account until I called the call center about 2 to 3 times and logged a complaint. Finally, I was told to contact my branch, who redirected me to the Forex Department. After being transferred around since nobody was sure who was the right person, explaining the entire problem, I finally got transfered to the right person. As soon as I told him my name, he started with &#8220;We&#8217;ve been trying to contact you.&#8221; This was just surprising and out of the blue. My bank has my phone number, email, and home address. How the hell did they try to contact me? <a href="http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Iris_Message">Iris Messages</a>? Because, I definitely didn&#8217;t get a call, an email, or a letter. I went to the bank because they wanted me to fill up a form. He turned out to be the Deputy Manager in the Forex Department and insisted that the form had to be filled in original and they wanted a copy of my invoice before they released my money. I don&#8217;t know if this is what they call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>, but I played along in November, December, and January because there were other things happening in my life that didn&#8217;t allow me to change banks.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="That's me, when I have to deal with this mess" src="http://nigelb.me/img/headdesk.gif"></div>
<h2 id="march-incident">March Incident</h2>
<p>A payment was made into my account on the March 1, 2013. Today is March 15, 2013. I went to the bank on Wednesday, the 13th, to fill up the form, assuming my money would be released then. Except it wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s been 2 full weeks, how are you guys dealing with wire transfers? With carrier pigeons? Because they&#8217;d be faster. I&#8217;ve checked with my other colleague in India, and he definitely gets the money faster than me. It takes 7 days for him, which is the max he&#8217;s seen. I&#8217;ve never seen money come into my account any faster than 10 days.</p>
<h2 id="and-in-conclusion">And In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can imagine some of this is part of RBI&#8217;s strict control about foreign currency and all that. But seriously? This is just hurting those of us who deal with international transfers on a regular basis for completely legal reasons. First step, I&#8217;m going to change banks. As soon as I receive the money for this month, I&#8217;m going to walk into an SBI branch and open an account. I&#8217;ve talked to a bunch of people and least troublesome bank so far seems to be SBI. And It also helps that they give the best exchange rate. And this morning I&#8217;ve been greeting <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/cobrapost-sting-hdfc-bank-icici-bank-axis-bank-in-moneylaundering-net-rbi-probes/1088071/0">ironic news</a> of Axis, HDFC, and ICICI are being alleged to be assisting with money laundering. I almost thought that was from Faking News.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: This post was written in extreme anger. I may end up withdrawing it later, but hell, I had to write it and get it off my chest.</p>

    <p>I was in the UK for 3 weeks recently, and I &#8220;made the mistake&#8221; of walking into a WHSmith bookstore. I still haven&#8217;t built up the necessary self-control to walk into a bookstore and walk out without buying a book. In this instance though, I actually did walk out without buying a book. Instead, I bought a <a href="http://www.whsmith.co.uk/eReaders/KoboToucheReader.aspx">KoboTouch</a>. I really had no intention of buying one when I walked into the store, I was only going to look at it. Eventually, though, a combination of a really friendly sales person, reasonable pricing, and common sense won out; and I walked out with the KoboTouch, a case, and a light. Common sense, because I&#8217;ve almost run out of space for physical books. It&#8217;s been a little over 3 weeks since I&#8217;ve bought the Kobo and I&#8217;ve read for a total of about 60 hours and finished 9 books. I think I might have a problem :P</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><img alt="Kobo Touch" src="http://nigelb.me/img/kobo.jpg"></div>
<p>I downloaded a few books from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg</a>, mostly classics, that I wanted to re-read. I hate to admit it, but I ended up pirating a few books too because, some of the books were simply priced too high . I could buy it from Amazon for a cheaper price, but they would be DRM&#8217;d. While music is most available to be bought DRM-free, ebooks aren&#8217;t there yet. How I wish I could I could compare prices on multiple providers and buy from the one that has the cheapest. I <em>think</em> I can buy books from any provider that sells epubs with Adobe DRM, but I&#8217;m yet to risk it. I&#8217;m sure over the next few months, I&#8217;ll buy at least one book each month. Definitely more often than I used to before I owned the Kobo since buying is so easy.</p>

    <p>First things first, Newcastle City Council plans to close down 10 libraries across the city as part of a wider series of budget cuts. This represents the closure of more than half of all existing branches and will cause considerable harm, apart from being just silly.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about it, head to <a href="http://savenewcastlelibraries.org">SaveNewcastleLibraries.org</a> to find ways to get involved, or click on the image below to open a map showing the location of the planned closures, as well as the contact details for their local councillors.</p>

<div><a href="http://amercader.github.com/savenewcastlelibraries/" target="_blank">http://amercader.github.com/savenewcastlelibraries/</a></div>
</div>
<p>The rest of this post explains the story behind the data used to build this map.</p>
<h2>A call for action</h2>
<p>A while ago I learnt about the mentioned plans that Newcastle City Council had for the local libraries via <a href="https://twitter.com/NewcastleCC/status/276989715637493760">one</a> of its tweets. Closing libraries is not a nice thing to do, so I was immediately curious about the extent of the proposal: would my local branch be affected?, how many branches across the city would close?</p>
<p>Buried deep beneath the linked survey website there was a link to a document with the <a href="http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/drupalncc.newcastle.gov.uk/files/wwwfileroot/your-council/budget_and_annual_report/budget_2016_-_9_-_library_network_reduction_0.pdf">Library Network Reduction Proposal</a> (pdf, 115 Kb), which you have to trawl to actually get the names of the affected libraries. These turned out to be 10 out of 18 existing branches, some of which I didn't know where were located, so my immediate reaction was to create a map with them. What if I also added the contact details from the local councillors for each branch so people could raise their concerns more easily?</p>
<p>That was it then, get the libraries locations and local councillors, a bit of processing to add the planned status to each library, put together a nice Leaflet / Mapbox combo and we are all set, right? Right?</p>
<p>Sadly it was not going to be that easy.</p>
<h2>Looking for available data</h2>
<p>The first port of call for spatial developers looking for free and open geodata is probably <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. Unfortunately, the library POIs for Newcastle on OSM were incomplete and included libraries which didn't belong to the Council, so that wasn't going to be an option.</p>
<p>Contrary to their <a href="http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4112">Sunderland neighbours</a>, the Newcastle City Council website does not have a public downloads page with Open Data datasets (In this sense, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackem">mackems</a> are well ahead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordie">geordies</a>). The closest I found was a <a href="http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/leisure-libraries-and-tourism/libraries/branch-libraries-and-opening-hours">page</a> with a Bing map showing libraries locations. It looked like it would be scrapping after all.</p>
<p>Now, a list of councillors and their email addressesses should be easy to find on any Council web site. Newcastle City Council one indeed has a <a href="http://democracy.newcastle.gov.uk/mgCommitteeMailingList.aspx?EM=1&amp;ID=218">list of all councillors</a> with their contact details, even comma separated! The fact that the list is printed on the page and not on a separate linked CSV file would be only mildly irritating if it wasn't for the fact that this list does not show which ward the councillors belong to, which is a quite important piece of information to miss.</p>
<p>The only way of getting the ward a coucillor belongs to is via a <a href="http://democracy.newcastle.gov.uk/mgFindCouncillor.aspx">web form</a>, so this one also looked like it was going to be copy &amp; paste.</p>
<h2>Structured data is born</h2>
<p>Michelangelo is quoted as saying that inside every block of marble there was a statue awaiting to be freed. Similarly, inside every dodgy web page from an organization there is a nice clean dataset awaiting to be created.</p>
<p>In these first stages, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling">data wranglers</a> need to get their hands dirty, copy and pasting or scrapping data into their favourite editors, doing some regexp wizardry and manually editing the data. The result is a file that can be used by a computer program to display its contents, transform its format, combine it with other files, etc.</p>
<p>In my case, I ended up with the libraries names and locations (plus plans according to the reduction proposal) in CSV and <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> format, which is very convenient for mapping applications.</p>
<pre>
<code>#libraries.csv
name,plan,due,longitude,latitude
"Moorside Library",close,"June 2013",-1.635681,54.976958
"Kenton Library",keep,,-1.653120,55.005594
[...]

#libraries.geojson
{"type":"FeatureCollection",
"features":[
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Moorside Library","plan":"close","due":"June2013"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.635681,54.976958]}},
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Kenton Library","plan":"keep","due":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.653120,55.005594]}},
//[...]
</code>
</pre>
<p>On the other side, thanks to the Coucil website, I had two different CSV for the councillors, one with the contact details of each councillor and another with their ward and party.</p>
<p>So what needed to be done was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out on which ward was located each library.</li>
<li>Merge the two councillors files to have a single file with the ward and email of each councillor.</li>
<li>Assign the relevant councillors to each library depending on the ward they were located.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To which ward belongs library X?</h3>
<p>The basic operation that we need to perform is knowing the location of a point (a library), extract an attribute from a polygon layer that contains it (a ward). People familiar with GIS will probably think about doing a <a href="http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/wkshop/join_spatial.php">spatial join</a>, but in my case I didn't have the wards polygon layer, and if there is a suitable API available there is a quicker way if you don't mind putting together a quick script.</p>
<p>This API is the excellent <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/">MapIt</a> by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">MySociety</a>. It basically returns administrative areas for any given point or postcode (in the UK) which is exactly what we need here. A request looks like this one, note the latitude and longitude at the end:</p>
<pre>
<code>http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/-1.635681,54.976958
</code>
</pre>
<p>This Python script reads the libraries GeoJSON file, loops through each library and queries the MapIt API for its coordinates, storing the result back in a new GeoJSON file:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>As a small aside, it is worth mentioning that the MapIt API is also a great way of obtaining the geometries of administrative areas, which are already returned as GeoJSON. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/amercader/newcastle-libraries-data/blob/master/3-get_wards.py">this script</a> will get all ward geometries for Newcastle, but it should be trivial to adapt to any other area.</p>
<p><img alt="Wards" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/wards-small.png"></p>
<h3>Cleaning up and merging CSV files</h3>
<p>For cleaning and working with CSV files or spreadsheets, <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> (The Software Formerly Known As Google Refine) is extremely useful. It is definitely very recommended for anyone looking for a good tool for working with data, and there are several good resources across the web to help you getting started.</p>
<p><img alt="Wards" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/google-refine.png"></p>
<p>OpenRefine allows you to perform basic cleaning up operations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding blank cells (Select column menu &gt; <em>Facet</em> &gt; <em>Customized facets</em> &gt; <em>Facet by blank</em>)</li>
<li>Trim spaces (Select column menu &gt; <em>Edit cells</em> &gt; <em>Common transforms</em> &gt; <em>Trim leading and trailing whitespace</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But it also supports more advanced stuff, like importing a column from another file which can be joined by a common column. In my case, I needed to import the "Email" column from the contact details file into the one that had the ward names, and the common column was the councillor name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Load both files into OpenRefine (in my case "councillors wards csv" and "councillors address csv"</li>
<li>On the wards one, on the column "name" &gt; <em>Edit column</em> &gt; <em>Add column based on this column...</em></li>
<li>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/GRELOtherFunctions#cross(cell_c,_string_projectName,_string_columnName">cross</a> function needs to be used: <code>cell.cross("councillors address csv","Name").cells["Email"].value[0]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Done. The resulting file can be exported again as CSV using the option on the top right side of the page.</p>
<h3>Joining libraries and councillors via wards</h3>
<p>Once the libraries and councillors datasets were ready, they only needed to be joined via the common field, the ward name. I used another small Python script for this:</p>
<div class="codehilite">
<pre>

</code>
</pre></div>
<p>The end result was a GeoJSON file which, apart from the location information, contained data about the ward and the councillors for each library, just what was needed for the web map.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many ways in which a dataset like this one could have been produced, for example using only Python scripts or libraries like <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, or doing the whole process in OpenRefine. (also, given enough time, there is always the hard way of copying and pasting things on a spreadsheet).</p>
<h2>Telling a story with data</h2>
<p>Developers used to work with data may find some pleasure in nice and cleaned up datasets per se, but most people won't share our excitement at the sight of a CSV file or a JSON API. Data needs to visualized and used in a way that gives meaning to it.</p>
<p>A list of library names in a PDF does not tell you much. Even a list of libraries and the plans for them in a spreadsheet is not likely to have a big impact on you. But map these libraries across the city, clearly flagging the proposed closures, and the scale of the proposal starts becoming apparent. Put the contact details of the local councillors that represent you just one click away from the library that is meant to be closed and maybe people would find easier to raise their concerns.</p>
<p>This is one of the promises and goals of Open Data. Make easier for data to find its way to citizens and have an impact on their lives.</p>

    <p>Hello from Mozcamp Asia! I&#8217;ve just gotten back from the welcome event at Mozcamp. It&#8217;s been great to meet friends I&#8217;ve talked to on IRC or met at last year&#8217;s Mozcamp, and make new friends who&#8217;re at this year&#8217;s Mozcamp!</p>
<p>I was at <a href="http://singapore.the-hub.net/">The Hub</a> today morning after checking-in at the V-Hotel. Top priority today was setting up B2G on my laptop. I messed around with it for <em>hours</em> to finally learn, to great frustration and disappointment, that B2G on the linux desktop doesn&#8217;t work on Ubuntu 10.04. I know I can upgrade, but I really don&#8217;t want to do that in the middle of a conference. Well, looks like I&#8217;m not going to accomplish that Mozcamp Mission until I get home :(</p>
<p>Later, I was at the Scape, which is the venue for keynotes and a bunch of us had volunteered to help organize the swag bags. It was great to work with Mozillians and do small things to help with the event :) I was going to head over to The Hub right afterward, but then it started raining quite heavily! Of course, it&#8217;s Singapore! We&#8217;re going to hit this problem quite a few times over the next few days, it should be absolutely fun! (Although, I hope nobody falls sick). I went right back in and had a long and interesting chat with Mike Connor and Harold about Social API.</p>
<p>At 7, we had the Mozcamp registration and welcome party &#8211; an absolutely fabulous time that involved meeting lots of people, eating good food, meeting my Mozcamp buddy (Amy Tsay!), and of course, the country fair. The country fair was a great way to chat with everyone and kind of get semi-familiar about names to faces. Unforgettable moment of the day: Watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LK3V_NH-h0">Foxeh and Mozillians dance</a> to Gangam style.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: I&#8217;m trying to write a blog entry for every day of Mozcamp. I may or may not be able to pull this off, but I&#8217;m definitely going to be trying!</p>

  <div style="max-width:43em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; overflow:hidden;">
    <p>After a long day in front of your laptop or just to think of a fresh approach to that annoying bug, what's better than going for a run?</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://brunosan.eu/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/">amazing</a> <a href="http://mapbox.com/blog/2012-08-28-running-maps/">examples</a> out there of the kind of stuff you can do with your running data, and more and more readily available data visualization tools open a lot of possibilities.</p>
<p>To make easier to get started hacking with your running data to those of you who use <a href="http://runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a> (and to celebrate PostGIS day!), here is a small script that will import your data into PostGIS.</p>
<h2>Getting the data</h2>
<p>One thing I like about RunKeeper is that it does not lock your data and makes really easy to download it. Just head to the <a href="http://runkeeper.com/exportDataForm">export data page</a> and select the date range you prefer.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="RunKeeper Export" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/runkeeper_export.png" title="RunKeeper Export Data"></div>
<p>This will generate a zip file which contains two CSV files and as many GPX files as activities you have. The <em>cardioActivities.csv</em> file contains information about each run, such as date, total distance, average pace, etc., and crucially, the name of the GPX file which contains the track of the run. Our aim is to get this file exported as a table with all the data fields and a geometry column that contains the actual spatial data.</p>
<h2>Running the script</h2>
<p>You will obviously need PostgreSQL and PostGIS installed, and we are also going to use <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html">ogr2ogr</a> to import the geometries.</p>
<p>Extract the zip file and cd into it. Download the following script and tweak the configuration paramters to suit your needs (You may need to change the way psql is called depending on your Postgres authorization setup).</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>Once you have a nice structured table on PostGIS it can be easily loaded into a number of tools like <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> or QGIS. One quick way of having a nice temporal visualization of your runs is using <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/torque">Torque</a>, a library powered by <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>. If you upload your data to CartoDB you just have to enter your user name and table name to get a visualization of your runs.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="RunKeeper Torque" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/runkeeper_torque.png" title="RunKeeper Torque"></div>
<p>Here are some quick steps on how to get it working:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Export your data to one of the formats supported by CartoDB. Here I'm using GeoJSON:</p>
<pre>
<code>
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON activities.geojson PG:"dbname='db_test' host='localhost' port='5432' user='XXXXXX' password='YYYYYY'" TABLE_NAME</code>
</pre>
<p>Important: for some reason the GeoJSON import only works on CartoDB if the file is zipped, so create a zip of your file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an account on CartoDB if you don't already have one, sign in and select "Create a new table".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select "I want to start with some imported data" and pick the zipped GeoJSON file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all went right, you should see your records on a table. Select "Change data type" on the <em>date</em> field header and choose <em>Date</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Head to <a href="http://cartodb.github.com/torque">http://cartodb.github.com/torque</a>, enter your user name and table name on the top right boxes and click on "Update Torque". That's it! You can play around with the controls to change the visualization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this gets you inspired to play with your own data and do some nice visualizations or hacks!</p>

    <p>Since October, I&#8217;ve been a remote employee, working for the <a href="http://okfn.org">The Open Knowledge Foundtion</a>. I was nervous about being a remotee and I talked to a lot of my friends who&#8217;re remotees at Mozilla. Shout out to ashish, fox2mike, glob, and Unfocused for helping me out. I also enjoyed reading about people who wrote what their team did, particularly, RelEng at Mozilla, shout out to you guys as well! Also, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home">The Oatmeal</a> was right! Although, ironically, I&#8217;ve started to wake up unnaturally early <em>after</em> being a remote employee :P</p>
<p>The biggest fear about working from home were the distractions The most important distraction-killer is a time tracker. We use <a href="https://www.toggl.com/">toggl</a> for timesheeting anyway, and turning off the time tracker when I&#8217;m distracted helps. After a few times of doing that, I automatically stop myself when I&#8217;m getting distracted. I keep two Firefox profiles, one for work and one for everything else. While I&#8217;m working, the non-work profile is closed, so I can&#8217;t get distracted. I reward myself with time to look at it when I finish 2 hours of work and take a short break.</p>
<p>Having good communication channels is great since we&#8217;re distributed. Every day, our team gets on a stand up call. It&#8217;s great to actually hear everyone talk about their and ask for help from the team if they&#8217;re stuck. We also have a Campfire chat room and an IRC channel (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#okfn">#okfn on irc.freenode.net</a>); they keep me sane. Seriously. Speaking of sanity, on some days, the Campfire room is just a world of gifs, we&#8217;re awesome like that. There&#8217;s also the weekly <a href="http://notebook.okfn.org/">notebook</a> posts to keep track of what folks in other teams do.</p>

    <p>I finally managed to set aside some time to read <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book">OpenLayers Cookbook</a>, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/acanimal">Antonio Santiago</a>. Antonio is a great developer (you should definitely check his <a href="http://acuriousanimal.com/blog">blog</a> for some cool spatial development stuff) and a really nice guy, so I was looking forward to see how the book had turned up.</p>
<div class="image-right"><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book"><img alt="OpenLayers Cookbook" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/ol_cookbook.jpg" title="OpenLayers Cookbook"></a></div>
<p>As the rest of the Packt Cookbook series, the book is based on increasingly complex small code "recipes" that focus on a particular aspect of OpenLayers development. The recipes are grouped in thematic chapters, starting with the Web Mapping Basics, which covers topics like base layers and overlays, map controls and extent.</p>
<p>Next chapters are related with Raster and Vector layers, showing some examples on how to load different layer types and data formats, and exploring concepts like Protocols and Strategies, which can be sometimes tricky for new users.</p>
<p>The book moves onto Events (how to listen to map, feature and DOM events) and Controls. The Controls chapter gives a really good overview on how to add them to the map and configure them to interact with the map and layers.</p>
<p>Next comes the Theming chapter, which goes as far as OpenLayers will allow you to change its default looks. The next one, Styling Features is particularly comprehensive and covers all aspects of working with vector features with really nice examples, one of the points were OpenLayers is really powerful.</p>
<p>The last chapter, Beyond the Basics, explores more complex stuff with a couple of nice examples of more advanced uses of OpenLayers. Creating custom controls is particularly useful once you start working on big OpenLayers based applications. Some of the other recipes are perhaps a bit specific but give a good introduction to some useful OpenLayers features.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the book is very comprehensive and well written, and a lot of effort has obviously gone into it. All the recipes are included as web examples that can be downloaded from the publisher's web and opened in a browser. Antonio is clearly an expert on the field and this shows on the code and the explanations around it. The book is more orientated to novice and beginner users, and more experienced OpenLayers developers will probably skim through some of the recipes. All in all, a great book for your first dive into OpenLayers.</p>

    <p>This is a series of posts on migration from Apache and MySQL to Nginx+uwsgi and PostgreSQL. In this post, I&#8217;ll be detailing the steps we took to migrate the database from MySQL to PostgreSQL, with as little downtime as possible. Please leave a comment if you have suggestions!</p>
<h3 id="one-time-pre-migration-steps">One-time Pre-migration Steps</h3>
<p>#### UTF-8 The default encoding on PostgreSQL is SQL_ASCII and you probably want UTF-8. If you don&#8217;t know what you want, you want UTF-8 (trust me). The easiest way was to <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/pg-encoding-ubuntu/">blow away the default cluster and re-create it</a> (Thanks jacobian!)</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash">sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 9.1 main
sudo pg_createcluster --start -e UTF-8 9.1 main</code>
</pre></div>
<h4 id="make-postgresql-listen-on-all-interfaces">Make PostgreSQL listen on all interfaces</h4>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf</code> and ensure PostgreSQL is listening on all interfaces.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="text">listen_addresses = '0.0.0.0'</code>
</pre></div>
<h4 id="allow-access-to-postgresql-from-the-old-server">Allow access to PostgreSQL from the old server</h4>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf</code> and add an entry for the old server (where 123.123.123.123 is the IP address of the old server).</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="text">host    all             all             123.123.123.123/32       md5</code>
</pre></div>
<h4 id="install-client-libraries-on-the-old-server">Install client libraries on the old server</h4>
<p>We use sqlalchemy for db access and I had to do <code>apt-get install python-psycopg2</code>.</p>
<h4 id="creating-users-and-databases">Creating Users and Databases</h4>
<p>Our process is to create a user for each app and have that app&#8217;s database be owned by this user, here&#8217;s a script that automated creating the user and database.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
sudo -u postgres createuser -d -R -S <span class="nv">$1</span>
sudo -u postgres createdb <span class="nv">$1</span> -O <span class="nv">$1</span></code>

<h3 id="the-move">The move</h3>
<p>#### Import Preparation Create user and database on the new server with the script above. Remember to set a password for this new user.</p>
<h4 id="exporting">Exporting</h4>
<p>The most worrisome bit about the whole migration was exporting the data from MySQL and importing it into PostgreSQL. We used <a href="https://github.com/maxlapshin/mysql2postgres/">mysql2psql</a> and it didn&#8217;t give a lot of troubles except for the bit where floats got a little messed up. My personal recommendation is to not use <code>real</code>, but use <code>numeric(7,4)</code> with the accuracy adjusted for what you need (this particular definition is used for our lat/long definitions.</p>
<p>First, run <code>mysql2psql</code> on your command line, this will create the config file.</p>
<p>Now edit the <code>mysql2psql.yml</code> file and add your appropriate entries. Here&#8217;s what ours looked like</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mysql</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">hostname</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">localhost</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">port</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">3306</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">socket</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">username</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mysuperuser</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">password</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mypassword</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">database</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mydb</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">destination</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>

 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">file</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mydb.sql</span>
 <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">postgres</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">hostname</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">localhost</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">port</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">5432</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">username</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mysql2psql</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">password</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">database</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mysql2psql_test</span>

<span class="c1"># if tables is given, only the listed tables will be converted.  leave empty to convert all tables.</span>
<span class="c1">#tables:</span>
<span class="c1">#- table1</span>
<span class="c1">#- table2</span>
<span class="c1"># if exclude_tables is given, exclude the listed tables from the conversion.</span>
<span class="c1">#exclude_tables:</span>
<span class="c1">#- table3</span>
<span class="c1">#- table4</span>


<span class="c1"># if supress_data is true, only the schema definition will be exported/migrated, and not the data</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">supress_data</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">false</span>

<span class="c1"># if supress_ddl is true, only the data will be exported/imported, and not the schema</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">supress_ddl</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">false</span>

<span class="c1"># if force_truncate is true, forces a table truncate before table loading</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">force_truncate</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">false</span></code>
</pre></div>
<p>When you run <code>psql2mysql</code> again, it will export the database <code>mydb</code> into <code>mydb.sql</code>. Before we did that, we removed this particular site from /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and restarted apache. We didn&#8217;t want the sql file to go stale as soon as it was exported. This is where the downtime starts</p>
<h4 id="importing">Importing</h4>
<p>Copy the file over to the new server and import it into PostgreSQL with psql.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash">sudo -u mydb psql mydb &lt; mydb.sql</code>
</pre></div>
<p>In retrospect, I should have just imported it directly with <code>mysql2psql</code>. I was initially hesitant because it involved creating a user that could access that machine from outside. But I later realized I needed it anyway.</p>
<h3 id="go-live">Go live!</h3>
<p>Now change the settings on the old server to use the postgres database as the backend, enable the site in Apache and you&#8217;re all set to serve this site from PostgreSQL!</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been about 10 months since I&#8217;ve started working at <a href="http://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a> and it&#8217;s been an amazing few months. I&#8217;ve been part of 4 amazing conferences, a workshop, and a bunch of <a href="http://geekup.in">Geekups</a>. Among other things, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://github.com/hasgeek">written code</a>, <a href="http://rootconf.in">organized content</a>, and <a href="http://youtube.com/user/hasgeek">edited videos</a>. It&#8217;s probably the most intense job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p>When I joined HasGeek last year, I&#8217;d committed for a minimum of 6 months. After 10 months at HasGeek, I&#8217;m moving on. I&#8217;m very exicted to announce that starting Oct 2, I&#8217;ll be working for the <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> a Data Wrangler and Web Developer! I&#8217;m very excited and looking forward to working with the amazing folks at OKFN.

  </header>
  <div style="max-width:43em; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; overflow:hidden;">
    <p>I spoke to Rufus Pollock from <a href="http://okfn.org">OKFN</a> a week ago and he encouraged me to try one of the <a href="http://wiki.okfn.org/Get_The_Data_Challenge">Get the Data challenges</a>. I decided to build the <a href="http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/">equivalent salary converter</a> since I&#8217;d always been curious to have some way to equivalent salary based on cost of living.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-data-i-need">What&#8217;s the data I need?</h2>
<p>The first challenge was to understand what data I needed to solve this problem. I spent a few hours reading the Wikipedia page for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">Purchasing Power Parity</a> . As someone who hated originally Economics, it took me a while to make some sense of all this. I further branched to reading about the Big Mac Index and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary-Khamis_dollar">Geary-Khamis dollar</a>, among others.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-data">Finding the Data!</h2>
<p>Since the original challenge itself is called &#8220;Get the Data Challenge&#8221;, I&#8217;ll honestly admit that this was perhaps the most challenging of all the tasks in building this application (XML parsing finished a close second :P). The Wikipedia article on Purchasing Power Parity has links to several data sources, which was a cause for great joy until I discovered all of them lead to 404s. I went through <a href="https://finances.worldbank.org/page/datasets">some parts of the World Bank data</a> and looked at the <a href="http://data.un.org/">UN Data</a> website. I was stuck at not knowing what exactly I was looking for.</p>
<p>At some point, as I was going through <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">another part of the World Bank data site</a>, I saw something about indicators and decided to poke at it. At one point, I even wondered if I should give up and pick some of the other interesting data available like <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS">Physicians per 1000</a>. Finally, I stumbled upon the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP">PPP conversion factor</a> data. I didn&#8217;t realize this was the data I needed until a little while later. For someone like me, who&#8217;s unfamiliar with the words involved, it&#8217;s not easy even recognizing that I&#8217;ve found what I was looking for. I exported the data from the World Bank website and decided to have a go at parsing it.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-the-data-aka-xml-hell">Parsing the data a.k.a. XML Hell</h2>
<p>76756 lines of XML?! It send shivers down my spine when I first opened the file. I started off with the lxml module to parse the data. It took me several hours of reading the documentation, and trial and error to get a hang of the API. I raced to write down a quick python script to take all the data from the XML and give me a CSV with data that I wanted. The original XML had much more data than I wanted. <a href="https://github.com/nigelbabu/pppconverter/blob/master/parsexml.py">The script</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nigelbabu/pppconverter/blob/master/data.csv">CSV output of the script</a> are both on GitHub if you&#8217;d like to look. I suspect if you&#8217;d like to play with another World Bank dataset, this script might give you a starting point. In retrospect, importing the data directly into <a href="http://explorer.datahub.io/">Recline DataHub</a> might have been a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-app">Writing the App</h2>
<p>I strongly believe in MVP when I build an application. My MVP when starting was getting a form working which would let me select a country of origin and a target country and it would calculate the salary for that country. This is what the app can currently do. The original challenge involved showing a map and clicking on a point in the map would show the equivalent salary for that country. I&#8217;m very glad that I decided on an easier to achieve MVP or else I&#8217;d have nothing to show right now. The UI is built on Zurb Foundation and the minimal backend is written in Flask. The first iteration of the app didn&#8217;t use client-side Javascript to do the calculation, the form was POSTed to the server for every calculation. Later, I wrote that logic in JavaScript and it falls back to server side for folks with JavaScript disabled.</p>
<p>Over the next 2 weeks, I&#8217;d like to try and get a map based on <a href="http://kartograph.org/">kartograph</a> working on the website. I got as far as being able to display the map, however, I couldn&#8217;t get click events to fire and I&#8217;m trying to figure out what&#8217;s wrong (Side Note: If you have any advice related to events on kartograph maps, please leave a comment or catch me on twitter/IRC). If I have enough time, I&#8217;d like to convert equivalent salary to dollars based on the day&#8217;s exchange rate and add a choropleth map to show which country would give the highest equivalent salary normalized to USD based on the day&#8217;s exchange rate (The current results are in local currency units). That&#8217;s much more complicated and it&#8217;s a stretch goal.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-isnt-perfect-though">The data isn&#8217;t perfect though</h2>
<p>After all this, I&#8217;ll have to add that the data isn&#8217;t perfect. The data I currently have is country-level Purchasing Power Parity conversion factor, but having lived in two cities in India, I know that it varies between cities too.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d have to say this was a fun experience and highly educational :-)</p>

    <p>We all love <a href="http://mozillamemes.tumblr.com">Mozilla Memes</a>, and there&#8217;s some of us who like Reddit. Beltzner started <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mozillamemes/">r/MozillaMemes</a> a while back and it was kind of painful to manually post each post onto Reddit for upvotes and discussion. It was painful enough, that we stopped doing that after some time. A few weekends ago, I had some free time and I wanted to write something interesting. That&#8217;s when I came up with <a href="http://github.com/nigelbabu/mozalien">mozalien</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><a href="http://mozillamemes.tumblr.com/post/28145053527/https-bugzilla-mozilla-org-page-cgi-id-splinter-h/"><img alt="I herd you liek Makefiles" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/img/mozilla-meme.png"></a></div>
<p>Mozalien is a bot that looks at RSS feed, and posts new posts to a given subreddit. Thanks to authors of <a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw">python client libraries for Reddit</a>, it even obeys the Reddit rate-limiting rules! I&#8217;ll be running it everyday locally to post updates to r/MozillaMemes. It&#8217;s still not perfect, for instance, everything posted with mozalien seems to going into the moderation queue and I&#8217;m having to clear it manually (that&#8217;s still easier that posting the URL to Reddit manually, so I&#8217;m going to bear with it for a bit). Suggestions/Patches welcome!</p>

    <p>Ever googled for Nginx configuration? For example, how to redirect <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> to <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>? I have, and guess what, most of the top results are wrong or inefficient. All of these are documented in <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls">a Pitfalls page on the Nginx wiki</a>.

<p>Remember to place your <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpCoreModule#root">root</a> directive outside any location block. Then, you can add another route for static files, just so that Nginx can serve them instead of that request going to PHP.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="nginx"><span class="k">location</span> <span class="s">^~</span> <span class="s">/pub/</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>By no means are these meant to be authoritative, and newer versions of Nginx lets you use <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpCoreModule#try_files">try_files</a> instead of some of what I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx Wiki</a>. RTFM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://princessleia.com/">Lyz</a> pointed out that the default config file that come with the CentOS packages on the Nginx website put root inside the location block instead of outside. She&#8217;s just helped me verify that and I verified the same problem with the Ubuntu packages from the Nginx website.</p>

    <p>At my <a href="http://hasgeek.com">day job</a>, one of the tasks that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jackerhack">Kiran</a> and I have to do frequently is to watch the job posting on the <a href="http://jobs.hasgeek.com">HasGeek Job Board</a> and reject the ones that don&#8217;t conform to our <a href="http://jobs.hasgeek.com/tos">Terms of Service</a>. Last night, Kiran pinged me on IRC with a link to a job that he wanted me to knock off. Usually, I use phpmyadmin to do this, but I thought I&#8217;d turn it into a bash script and started writing a mysql update query.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px 0;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/proimos/4199675334/"><img alt="Head in Hands by Alex E Proimos on Flickr" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/img/headdesk.jpg"></a></div>
<p>In retrospect, that&#8217;s probably my first mistake right there. Production server is really not the right place to have done this and I don&#8217;t even know why I thought it was a good idea. I wrote the query and executed it. Suddenly, I realized that I screwed up. I had that sinking feeling where you know exactly what went wrong and that it&#8217;s entirely your fault. I forgot the WHERE clause in the query and managed to reject every job in the job board. Thankfully, there was a backup handy, from about 10 minutes earlier too. Because of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/asia/power-outages-hit-600-million-in-india.html">power outages in North India</a> and the fact that our servers are hosted by <a href="http://e2enetworks.com/">E2E Networks</a> in Delhi, I had set up hourly backups earlier in the day. Quickly, I brought down apache and started restoring from the backup. In about 10 minutes from executing the wrong query, we were back and running.</p>
<p>We had two things to take away from this mistake &#8211; modifying the database directly should stop, and hourly backups are a good. We don&#8217;t have a lot of data yet, and hourly backups don&#8217;t take a lot of time. I spent all day today <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob/pull/33">writing code</a> so that we don&#8217;t touch the database manually ever for this. There&#8217;s been a plan to write this code for months, but true motivation came in the form of this embarrassing mistake. Most of us hate admitting our mistakes, but when working on servers, it is essential we move to a <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">culture of blameless post-mortems</a> to fix broken systems and ensure the same mistakes aren&#8217;t repeated or at least occur less frequently.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been using vim for a while now, I guess about 2 years? Heck, I&#8217;m even writing this post in vim (yay, jekyll!). After all this, I was using arrow keys for moving around in vim. I thought, they worked for me, until I recently read a <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">blog post about vim</a>. One of the suggestions in there was to map the arrow keys to in normal mode and insert mode. I&#8217;ve tried it out for a week now, and I wonder, how did I ever use the arrow keys; h, j, k, and l make so much more sense!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve always wanted to get rid of your arrow key habit, add this to your .vimrc!</p>

<p>The one place where I used arrows was for vim completion with ^N and ^P. Quickly, I learned that ^N and ^P can replace the arrow keys there too! It&#8217;s still not yet muscle memory, but pretty close.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been quite a while since I blogged, more than 6 months or so. Between a family emergency in December, then switching to a Macbook since Jan, and then jekyll not working properly on it (entirely due to my lack of ruby knowledge/experience), I never found the time. Hopefuly, I&#8217;ll have more time in the coming weeks (yeah, right :P). On Sunday, I noticed <a href="http://julython.org">Julython</a> pop up in my twitter feed. It&#8217;s an event about encouraging developers of all skill levels to try and work on their pet project(s) just a little each day, in this instance specific to python-related projects. This reminded of a project I started a while back to get a hang of MongoDB called <a href="https://github.com/nigelbabu/geektionary">Geektionary</a>. I spend some time plotting and it seems like a perfect fit to do a Julython project. I get to learn lots of new things and start a project from scratch to finish on my own.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://github.com/hasgeek">work</a>, we use Flask all the time, but we have our own <a href="http://github.com/hasgeek/hgapp">boilerplate</a> for our Flask apps. For Geektionary, I&#8217;m using the <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to">large app how-to</a> on the Flask wiki. I made some modification to that example and already got something basic up and running. The change I&#8217;ve made is to change how configuration is handled, I&#8217;ve always liked to have a base settings file, and then a local file overriding it. Thanks to Julython, I think I&#8217;ll be working on Geektionary a little bit each day to make a final product that allows login with <a href="http://browserid.org">BrowserID</a> and all that jazz ;-)</p>
<p>Speaking of BrowserID, another thing I want to do over this July, if I have time, is to port mkelly&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/osmose/django-browserid">django-browserid</a> to Flask. It is non-trivial because I need to support multiple DB backends somehow. I have a basic idea of what I want to do in my head, I&#8217;m just hoping to find some time to punch it out into code.</p>

    <p>(For the eager ones, I've written a <a href="http://amercader.github.com/wikigeolinks-leaflet">new version of WikiGeoLinks</a> with Leaflet and Bootstrap. It lets you discover interactively how the georeferenced articles of the Wikipedia are connected. If you want the long story, scroll down...)</p>
<div class="image"><a href="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/80_map_large.png"><img alt="Around the world in 80 Wikipedia articles" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/80_map.png"></a>
<div class="caption">Click to enlarge</div>
</div>
<p>I'm sure one of the most common ways in which people use Wikipedia is jumping to different articles from the original one they were checking in the first place. At least that's how I spent most of the time on it, getting dragged into interesting stuff. This can be of course a great productivity killer, but I think this "courseless" browsing is very rewarding because you never know what you'll end up discovering.</p>
<p>I've also always liked this mental image of linked Wikipedia articles forming a huge network with clusters around popular articles, and sure <a href="http://infodisiac.com/Wikimedia/Visualizations/">there</a> <a href="http://www.chrisharrison.net/projects/wikiviz/index.html">are</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juhansonin/407874864/sizes/l/in/photostream/">countless</a> visualizations all over the Internet that show at least at part of this mammoth graph.</p>
<p>But what about the spatial connections between Wikipedia articles? A huge number of articles have coordinates associated, and are obviously linked to other ones, so how would this network look like on a map? One could try to create a global, static visualization like the one that came up a while ago of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=469716398919">Facebook connections</a>, but as beautiful as these images are, they are not interactive. I wanted some form of the "mindless" browsing I mentioned before, that would allow discovering interactively what articles were located around a certain area and which other articles they linked to.</p>
<p>That's why a while ago I wrote a <a href="http://amercader.net/dev/wikigeolinks-geoext/">first version of WikiGeoLinks</a> , a web application that let you locate Wikipedia articles on a map and see how were they connected. This first version was built with <a href="http://geoext.org">GeoExt</a> and <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>, and used a GeoJSON web service powered by <a href="http://mapfish.org">MapFish</a>. After locating an article on the map, its linked articles were shown and you could click on them to see their connections, carrying on for as long as you wanted.</p>
<h2>Making it nicer</h2>
<p>I was definitely happy with the original version, and it was a great opportunity to learn in depth how GeoExt works, but to be fair it didn't look that nice. Ext based applications have a very specific and valid use case, but I wanted the site to be lighter and more attractive, both visually and in the code.</p>
<p>The first step was switching the default OpenStreetMap tiles to the ones that have become my first choice in all my recent projects: <a href="http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/map">MapQuest-OSM</a>. They offer direct access to the tiles, which are OSM based and look gorgeous (specially at small scales), so what's not to love about it?</p>
<div class="image-right"><img alt="Leaflet Logo" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/leaflet_logo.png"></div>
<p>I had played around a bit with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">Leaflet</a> before, but this was a good opportunity to use it in a complete project, learn how it worked and see how it compared to OpenLayers, the mapping library I have more experience with. Praising Leaflet at this stage may seem unnecessary, but I'll do it anyway: it is a joy to work with it. Its API is clean, simple and intuitive. It is fast, easy to extend and ridiculously light-weight. If you are used to OpenLayers though, you may find some things confusing at first. I'll try to write another blog post going in more detail about this.</p>
<p>Finally, to glue it up all together I've used <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>, which is quickly becoming the cornerstone of dozens of websites. It has turned out to be a great tool for online mapping applications, and the widgets it offers are easy to integrate as traditional map controls like toolbars or layer switchers.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>There are a number of things I would like to add or improve, here are a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://amercader.net/dev/wikipedia">underlying data</a> is outdated and does not include all georeferenced articles. I plan to use the more up to date data available at the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProjekt_Georeferenzierung/Wikipedia-World/en">Wikipedia-World</a> project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/amercader/wikigeolinks">GeoJSON service</a> can be a little bit slow. It can probably be optimized in some ways (or maybe I need to upgrade my Linode...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would love to have some way to generate a permalink to a series of linked articles, so you can save your "routes".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can definitely be made more mobile friendly, for instance avoiding hover events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And some other, more vague ideas (some of them definitely pointless):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe the Wikipedia API can be used to pull some more content about the articles in the popups (summary, pictures...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you build a Wikipedia "route planner"? e.g can I go from <a href="http://amercader.github.com/wikigeolinks-leaflet?a=La%20Paz">La Paz</a> to <a href="http://amercader.github.com/wikigeolinks-leaflet/?a=Matsushima">Matsushima</a> via georeferenced Wikipedia articles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How cool would it be to be able to do the same on a <a href="http://www.webglearth.org/">3D Globe</a>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you like it and spend some time wandering around. I would love to hear your comments, and also feel free to add any issues you may find to GitHub, where you can also find the <a href="https://github.com/amercader/wikigeolinks-leaflet">source code</a>.</p>

    <p>Let's be completely honest, we all knew it was going to happen. You start a new blog (maybe you've even built the engine yourself), add some enthusiastic new posts, start publishing fairly regularly... And then at some point you start procrastinating a bit, telling yourself that next weekend you are going to write about this new thing you've found and without knowing it has been eight months since your last post.</p>
<p>Well, in my defence I have to say it has been a pretty busy year. Last March I started working full time for the <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. The OKF is a not-for-profit devoted to promoting open access to knowledge and data, and it is involved in a ridiculous amount of awesome projects. Check for instance the <a href="http://openshakespeare.org">annotated works of Shakespeare</a>, <a href="http://openspending.org">OpenSpending</a>, an effort to structure and visualize government budget spending, and one of my favourites, <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org">the Public Domain Review</a>. You can find more active <a href="http://okfn.org/projects">projects</a> and <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo">mailing lists</a> on the OKF website, and if you want to meet brilliant and talented people do not hesitate to get involved!</p>
<div class="image-left"><a href="http://ckan.org"><img alt="CKAN logo" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/ckan_logo.png" title="CKAN logo"></a></div>
<p>One of the main projects of the OKF, and the one I work full-time on, is <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/okfn/ckan">open source</a> data catalog platform. The aim of CKAN is to provide a robust and flexible platform for publishing, discovering and sharing data. It powers institutional catalogs like the <a href="http://data.gov.uk">British</a> and <a href="http://data.norge.no/">Norwegian</a> government open data catalogs, as well as community instances like <a href="http://thedatahub.org">The Data Hub</a> or the ones maintained in <a href="http://wiki.ckan.org/Instances">different countries</a>.</p>
<p>The first project I was involved with was the UK Location Programme. It is integrated with the mentioned Data.gov.uk (DGU), and it acts as the spatial data infrastucture for supporting the pan-european INSPIRE directive. A lot of work on this front was related with harvesting multiple CSW servers to aggregate their records in the DGU portal.</p>
<div class="image-right">
<div><a href="http://publicdata.eu"><img alt="Publicdata.eu" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/pdeu.png" title="Publicdata.eu"></a></div>
<div><a href="http://iatiregistry.org"><img alt="IATI Registry" src="http://amercader.net/simg/posts/iati.png" title="IATI Registry"></a></div>
</div>
Another really interesting OKF project I worked on was <a href="http://publicdata.eu">Publicdata.eu</a>, an experimental portal that aggregated open datasets from catalogs across Europe. My colleague Friedrich Lindenberg wrote a <a href="http://ckan.org/2011/06/23/publicdata-eu-data-apps-and-800000-triples/">nice post</a> presenting it, if you want to know more about it. I was even able to squeeze a couple of <a href="http://publicdata.eu/map">maps</a> in there!
<p>One of the projects I've been more involved recently is the <a href="http://iatiregistry.org">IATI Registry</a>, also powered by CKAN. <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/">IATI</a> is an international initiative to promote transparency on aid spending. It provides a common <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">standard</a> on which funding organisations can publish their activities, allowing stakeholders and third-parties to analyze and visualize this spending data. The registry provides a centralized point where organisations can publish their IATI compliant files so users can access them via the web interface or the API.</p>
<p>And of course, apart from working on specific projects I've been involved in the usual day to day tasks in a big open source project like CKAN, building features, fixing bugs, supporting users... All of this with a brilliant (remote) team and learning an awful lot of stuff on the way!</p>
<p>So all in all, 2011 has been an intense and exciting year and it looks like 2012 won't dissapoint either, with new projects and features coming up.</p>
<p>Hopefully it won't take me months to tell you about them.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<span class="nt">&lt;robcee&gt; </span>it was a good run</code>
</pre></div>
<p>So, yeah, I&#8217;ve switched to clang on Ubuntu. A quick rundown of what I did for any Ubuntu or other Linux users. The instructions are pretty much the same as what <a href="http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2011-10-18/why-you-should-switch-clang-today-and-how">ehsan posted for Mac</a>, except I didn&#8217;t install clang system-wide.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash">mkdir clang
<span class="nb">cd </span>clang
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm
<span class="nb">cd </span>llvm/tools
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang
<span class="nb">cd</span> ../../
mkdir build
<span class="nb">cd </span>build
../llvm/configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions
make</code>
</pre></div>
<p>This got the clang binary in <code>Release/bin</code>. I use <span class="caps">ZSH</span>, so I added that folder to my $<span class="caps">PATH</span> variable like so</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:<span class="nv">$HOME</span>/clang/build/Release/bin</code>
</pre></div>
<p>The last bit is to add the following to your .mozconf</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">CC</span><span class="o">=</span>clang

    <p>Finally, I&#8217;m getting around the write my MozCamp Asia post. This has been long pending and got delayed mostly because I&#8217;ve been writing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=609730">patches</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704204">for</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=642598">Firefox</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=698662">and</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641527">Thunderbird</a> instead of writing a blog post :P</p>
<h5>Travel</h5>
<p>The night before I was to due to travel, I fell ill and almost called the whole thing off. After taking a break for a day, I decided that I was good to go, started packing, and left for the airport. At the airport, I was sitting down and finishing the slides for my talk since I never got a chance thanks to work and other commitments. We landed in Kuala Lumpur at about 12 am local time and I got into my room at 2:30 am. I ended up waking up my roommate, Siddharth, who I&#8217;ve known for a while but never met. With all the excitement of the event, and also because it was just 12 am in India, I was wide awake (Proud member of <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/group/10791-weird-hours">Weird Hours</a>) . At some point, I even thought of not sleeping, but thankfully, I caught about 3 hours of sleep, which at least saved the day to some extent.</p>
<h5>Day 1</h5>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img alt="Day 1, right before we started" src="http://nigelb.me/img/mozcamp-1.jpg" title="Day 1, right before we started"></p>
</div>
<p>At Breakfast, I met the &#8220;IT crowd&#8221; &#8211; fox2mike, zandr, phong, and bkero. Fun gang, we were hanging out later on Sunday. I then hurried to the Welcome session by Mitchell Baker. I don&#8217;t remember most of the session now, but I remember tweeting like crazy all through the morning. The update from Mozilla China was particular interesting because, as the representative from China said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have Facebook or Youtube on our internet&#8221;. I also remember Mozilla Japan had an interseting video of their work and Chibi was on stage for the first time giving a talk in English. We had extra applause for her courage :-) During the coffee break, I caught up with Tim Watts, who works on the <a href="http://support.mozilla.org"><span class="caps">SUMO</span> team</a>. We realized that we were planning on talking about the same thing and decided we&#8217;d merge our talks into one (all the work I did in the airport had to be re-done. <span class="caps">YAY</span>!). Mary then talked about Engagement. There was a lot of learning from that session, like the fact that 2.2 million people download firefox every day, and about the huge poster in the <span class="caps">JFK</span> arrival area. Everyone loved the &#8220;Don&#8217;t work for the man, work for the mankind&#8221; <a href="http://yfrog.com/gzslzztmj">poster</a>. Then, we had the most exciting bit ever, the community quilt. It was great to listen to all the communities talk about their efforts and also about their challenges. Again, it was great to hear people give a talk for the first time, especially in a langauge they&#8217;re not used to speaking all the time.</p>
<p>At lunch, I met Khairul (ejat) who I also know from the Ubuntu community and Stormy Peters who I&#8217;ve heard about from friends. After lunch I took one look at the schedule and wished I had a time machine. I wanted to attend all the sessions! After lunch I attended the session about building community websites. It was interesting to hear Laura talk about the Mozilla websites from the product owner&#8217;s point of view. After this, I went to the talk about Developer Evangelism, <span class="caps">MDN</span>, and Docs. We all agreed to blog about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org"><span class="caps">MDN</span></a> and push it up in search rankings instead of &#8220;other&#8221; usual sources (I&#8217;m looking at you w3schools). Next was probably one of the most interesting sessions for me, David Dahl&#8217;s &#8220;From Web Developer to Firefox Hacker&#8221; session. I&#8217;ve been shying away from hacking on Firefox or Thunderbird, because I&#8217;m not exactly a C++ person. ddahl&#8217;s session kind of got me intersted in Firefox hacking and I&#8217;ve been doing a fair bit of Firefox hacking since I got back (Thanks again ddhal!). The last session for the day was the user engagement session by Chelsea and William. It was nice to hear about <a href="https://affiliates.mozilla.org">Affiliates</a> and about how campaigns could use a lot of localized help to connect to the right audience.</p>
<p>Most of the things after this is a blur thanks to the lack of sleep from previous night. We went had dinner at a resturant which also had a cultural show, but I was too tired to watch any of it and just headed back to the hotel to crash.</p>
<h5>Day 2</h5>
<p>On the Day 1 open session, Mitchell announced that we&#8217;d all have wake up calls at 8 am and they actually did it! Thankfully, I&#8217;d set a 7 am wake up call, so we didn&#8217;t have the 8 am wake up call, but I did see other people comment about it on twitter. Despite all this, we did start about 15 minutes late because we waited for everyone to finish breakfast. I was much more alert thanks to a good night&#8217;s sleep. We opened the day with the &#8220;State of the Product&#8221; talk. There was a lot of applause during the talk, especially for the B2G demo (philikon and qDot recently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuIQskGD3u0">managed to get the B2G phone to dial</a>!). It was mind blowing to see the View Source. The devtools demo, especially, the Tilt demo also generated a fair bit of applause. After this, I attended Siddharth&#8217;s session about building a Thunderbird Extension. Sid0 demoed writing a simple Hello World extension to using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Thunderbird/gloda">Gloda</a>. It was a fun session with a lot of code to digest through. The WebFWD talk was something I was looking forward to and Diane explained about what WebFWD does and how it can help potential startups with the same ideologies as Mozilla, especially openess.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>The leader Q &amp; A was interesting for its format and for the questions that were asked. Some of the answers, like the ones about Mozilla Spaces, and Thunderbird were particularly interesting. Right after lunch, was the session about contributing to Mozilla webdev led by Tim Watts and I. We <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fox2mike/status/138143503912939520/photo/1">talked</a> about contributing to Mozilla&#8217;s Webdev projects, some of the blockers, and the respective solutions. Tim talked about everything except trouble with setting up the environment, while I focused on getting an environment setup with Vagrant. The audience already had people using Vagrant so it was fun to talk about it. We had most of Mozilla IT at our talk as well, so we had some good feeback from the about getting our environment as close as possible to production environment. I summarized most of these thoughts into a <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/11/24/guest-post-i-want-to-contribute-how-do-i-start/">blog post</a> on the Mozilla WebDev blog a few weeks back.</p>
<p>I then went to Dan&#8217;s session about BrowserID and apps. I had a lot of questions about BrowserID and few of us heckled Dan throughout and after the talk :P Nevertheless, it cleared up a lot of questions I had about BrowserID. The last session of the day before the closing was Community IT. Shyam, Phong, and Ben talked about the scale of IT at Mozilla and how they&#8217;re trying to open it up for the community to contribute. Memorable phrase from the session was &#8220;We&#8217;ll all be one big happy family and we&#8217;ll all have root&#8221; by fox2mike :-) (and yeah, he&#8217;s probably going to kill me for that). Another issue raised was how bouncer wasn&#8217;t working and needed some debugging; as time permits over the next few months I intend to look into this and figure out how to improve it. Finally, we had the closing remarks from Mitchell. It dawned on me that Mozcamp was over and most of us would be leaving that night or the next morning, and it was indeed saddening.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img alt="Always stylish ddahl in Jalan Aloor" src="http://nigelb.me/img/mozcamp-2.jpg" title="Always stylish ddahl in Jalan Aloor"></p>
</div>
<p>I joined Arky, bkero, cedricv, Dave, ddhal, fox2mike, Harinder, John, Mihca, phong, and zandr in exploring Jalan Aloor. Harinder suggested a chineese place there for dinner. It was indeed a great dinner. We did some experimentation with food &#8211; the biggest of which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">Durian</a>. When I entered the street I did smell some sort of sticky sweet smell which seemed pleasant. When we had the Durian, I matched the smell to Durian and it wasn&#8217;t so pleasant after that ;-) We also tasted some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakkwa">bakkwa</a> (bacon candy!) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambutan">Rambutan</a>. It was a long street filled with the most eatable things ever! We had a 10 pm drink up planned at the hotel, so we got back to hotel to be there on time, only to walk into an empty pub. Later everyone else joined us and we pretty much took over the pub. We were all chatting for the next few hours. I think it was eventually 4 am when I headed to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: I went to Mozcamp Asia, and started writing patches for Firefox :)</strong></p>

    <p>When working with Open Source, some of the best learnings come from code reviews. When I first started coding on projects with strict code reviews (<a href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>), I was uncomfortable getting nitpicked. I (wrongly) thought the goal was to have a code review that has absolutely no nitpicks (crazy right?). Whenever someone had a nitpick with my code, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t code properly. That&#8217;s when I read this <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/launchpad-dev/msg07867.html">excellent mail</a> from <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jtv">Jeroen Vermeulen</a> to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-dev">launchpad-dev team</a>:</p>
<p><em>A rubber-stamp approval can save you minutes or more in the short term, but it does nothing for your longer-term development. A rubber-stamp approval leaves you without proof that the reviewer has read and understood the branch. A rubber-stamp approval sets no performance bar, no communicable standard for reviewers to live up to. A rubber-stamp approval does not tell you whether your branch was excellent, so-so, or too hard to read. A rubber-stamp approval buys you time that you could use towards the self-improvement you&#8217;re missing out on, but fails to tell you where you need it most. A rubber-stamp approval deprives you of a chance to harmonize your part of the codebase with our best practices. So I don&#8217;t like getting rubber-stamped any more than I like to rubber-stamp others. Good reviews take time, and that&#8217;s not time I put in for the sheer fun of it.</em></p>

</div>
<p>It changed my world. I&#8217;ve had <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~nigelbabu/launchpad/bug-title-849121/+merge/75267">epic</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/input.mozilla.org/pull/29">nitpicky</a> code reviews after that. Its even changing how I do my code reviews; I&#8217;m warming up to be more nitpicky. Lesson learnt &#8212; code reviews are one of the strongest takeaways from open source. So, if you&#8217;re reviewing code, please nitpick. Don&#8217;t rubber stamp. The professional development of the person whose code you&#8217;re reviewing depends on it!</p>
<p>PS: For acceptable levels of nitpick ;-)</p>

    <p>There have been a fair number of responses to <a href="http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/how-i-got-involved-with-mozilla-and-why-that-wouldnt-work-today/">David Boswell&#8217;s post</a> about how he got involved with Mozilla. Most of the responses have been from fairly established contributors and contributing for a while. I thought I&#8217;d share my experience since I&#8217;ve been around for hardly 4 months now and moderately active.</p>
<p>My first attempt at contributing to Mozilla was a disaster. It was around January 2011 and I tried to contribute to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/" title="AMO">addons.mozilla.org</a> before its cleaned database was publically available. It took me a while to set the whole thing up and eventually when I did have things setup, I couldn&#8217;t properly reproduce bugs since I had no data and I had trouble adding new data. Eventually, I gave up out of frustration and I had lesser time available and my interest died out. Things have definitely changed since, the database for <span class="caps">AMO</span> is now downloadable and I&#8217;m pretty sure my setup troubles were my lack of experience; thank you Wil Clouser for being patient with me back then.</p>
<p>Around June 2011, I applied to a web developer opening at Mozilla. The email which confirms my application said this, &#8220;<em>If you&#8217;ve gotten this far, we&#8217;re certain you care about the future of the web. It&#8217;s easy to get involved and further that mission.</em>&#8221; I think this struck a note in me (whoever thought to add it, great job!). I wanted to give it another shot. This time, I just joined <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#webdev">#webdev</a> and asked if any projects needed help. <a href="http://davedash.com">Dave</a> quickly responded saying that <a href="http://input.mozilla.com">Input</a> could use some help and I started checking out the code and setting it up. By July, I had cleaned up <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=1513777&amp;emailtype1=substring&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;email1=nigelbabu%40gmail.com&amp;product=Input">most of the easy bugs on Input</a> and I continue to <a href="http://harthur.github.com/bzhome/?user=nigelbabu@gmail.com">help fix bugs</a>. I ended up not getting picked for the position I applied for, but I&#8217;m really glad to be contributing.</p>
<p>Things have changed since my attempt in January. There is now a significant interest in making virtual machine images available via either vagrant or some other means so setting up a dev environment is much easier (See posts by <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/">tofumatt</a>, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/10/02/putting-clouds-in-boxes">lochard</a>, and <a href="http://groovecoder.com/2011/10/11/virtual-machines-real-humans/">groovecoder</a>). This reduces the barrier of entry and frustration levels significantly. A frontend person need not be a linux sysadmin anymore to be able to fix a small <span class="caps">CSS</span> bug. Another good thing about this is, since everyone will be on the same environment, we&#8217;re reducing the chances of a weird environment problem.</p>

</div>
<p>Is the route I took still possible? I&#8217;d definitely say yes. If you know Python and Django or <span class="caps">PHP</span> or <span class="caps">CSS</span> or JavaScript, there are a bunch of webdev projects, and just asking in #webdev channel could guide you to projects that need help. It&#8217;s probably a good idea to ask during <span class="caps">UTC</span>-8 working hours since working hours of most of Mozilla WebDev overlap significantly around that time.</p>

    <p>When I started contributing to Mozilla Webdev, I started with <a href="http://input.mozilla.com">Input</a>. The bug that was always a mystery to me was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=658658">bug 658658</a>. The login page to Django&#8217;s admin worked in Django 1.2.3, but didn&#8217;t work with 1.3, which is what was in the input vendor. At that time, I didn&#8217;t know about monkeypatching Django well enough, or care enough to fix this. Last night, I was scrolling through <a href="http://harthur.github.com/bzhome/">bzhome</a> (Thanks again Heather!) to find this bug again.</p>
<p>This is how it looks before I fixed it</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img alt="Before fixing" src="http://nigelb.me/img/input-before.png" title="Before fixing"></p>
</div>
<p>After 3 hours of working with folks in #webdev, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jamessocol">jsocol</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peterbe">peterbe</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/r1cky">r1cky</a>, we finally <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/input.mozilla.org/commit/0ac2660d7dc4db2b3e1db5aed49124398a7fd2b4">fixed it</a>. The problem was that the monkey patching didn&#8217;t catch one case, the login and logout views which where not in <code>django.contrib.admin</code> but in <code>django.contrib.auth</code>. Thanks to everyone&#8217;s patience (especially r1cky, since we spent about 1 hour trying various combinations of things), the bug is fixed and I now know a little more about monkeypatching.</p>

    <p>User Days were created to be sets of classes offered during a one day period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics in order to get them started using Ubuntu. User Days were born out of a discussion at the Ubuntu Developers Summit in November 2009 regarding Ubuntu Open Week not being targeted enough at users. User Days is hosted over the weekend for many hours at a strech so everyone will be able to participate at some point. Open week, however, is hosted during the week at the fixed time-range.</p>
<p>This, however, is now changing. From this cycle on, Ubuntu Open Week will be targeted at users. As the organizers of User Days for the past 4 cycles, we&#8217;ve been wondering what the community thinks about this &#8211; Should we continue User Days or should we not. Please mark your opinion in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dGhpU2FZZmhURkNXU3JqaVQ4LUtVTHc6MQ#gid=0">quick poll that I&#8217;ve created</a></p>

    <p>A while back, I <a href="http://nigelb.me/ubuntu/launchpad/2011/09/02/some-new-improvements-to-lp.html">wrote</a> about smart autolinkifying in bugs.

The after effect is a &#8220;bug 1245&#8221; link in the body of Launchpad like in bug tracker, merge proposals, etc, where bug 1245 is a valid bug number will have its &#8220;title&#8221; attribute set to the bug title.</p>

    <p>Contributing to more Python projects like <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/Contributions">Launchpad</a> has also taught me about writing <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008">PEP8</a> compliant code. One is expected to run <code>make lint</code> and fix lint errors.</p>

<p>A major part of the code I write at my day job consist of scripts, which I most often prefer to write in Python (second only to bash). I hate to admit it, but my code is rarely pretty. I just write hacky scripts. I now use <a href="">pep8</a> and <a href="">pyflakes</a> on all the python code that I write. It does look nicer, although occasionally painful to fix ;) Almost all the time pyflakes help me catch an error in the script even before I run the script.</p>

    <p>Running 32-bit binaries on 64-bit machines and it refuses to work? Over the last one month this happened to me several times. Sometimes even disguised as something else. Finally, figured out the solution and noted it down all over the place so I don&#8217;t forget.</p>

    <p>Hello Planet Mozilla! I was added to the planet about 2 weeks ago and never actually got around to writing a hello post. I&#8217;m Nigel and I contribute to a few of the WebDev projects, most notably <a href="http://input.mozilla.org">input</a> and <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">socorro</a>. I&#8217;m also currently writing a patch for firefox to help <a href="http://support.mozilla.org"><span class="caps">SUMO</span></a>, which I seem to work on when I&#8217;m sleep deprived. I&#8217;m also an active contributor to Ubuntu and Launchpad and often blog about my work there, however, my posts to the planet will exclusively be the work I do on Mozilla projects. Hopefully, I shall have lots to write soon!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been hacking on Launchpad for a while now and I&#8217;d like to announce some of the new things I&#8217;ve added. The first 2 are in production now. The last two, however, will need a few more days to get into production.</p>
<h3>Smart autolinkifying in bugs</h3>
<p>As evident from the screenshot, it greys out the bug if the bug does not exit (or is private). I <a href="http://nigelb.me/webdev/launchpad/2011/08/24/another-launchpad-bug.html">wrote in detail</a> about fixing this earlier.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">UTC</span> offset along with timezone</h3>
<p>We now go the extra mile and display the <span class="caps">UTC</span> offset as well to help in some play plan out meetings, etc.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; height: 85px;">
<p><img alt="Timezone also shows UTC offset" src="http://nigelb.me/img/timezone.png" title="Timezone also shows UTC offset"></p>
</div>
<h3>Edit sprite for attachments</h3>
<p>Long time frustration of mine. The edit <span class="caps">URL</span> for attachments is in a portlet on the right side, not easy to spot. Once this fix rolls out, however, it will be much more friendlier.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; height: 85px;">

<h3>Better blueprints validation</h3>
<p>Earlier, I&#8217;d just get a &#8220;&#8230; is already registered by another blueprint&#8221;, this fix, once rolled out, helps ease out and find that blueprint.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<h4>7 Things</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>I live in a half-hour timezone</strong>. If you think timezones suck, trust me, half-hour timezones suck even more. Every calculation needs just a bit more time so that you don&#8217;t get it wrong. My sleep cycle is mostly <span class="caps">UTC</span> though ;)</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;ve only been involved with open source for less than 2 years</strong>. But I&#8217;ve contributed code to Ubuntu, Debian, Etherpad, Launchpad, Mozilla WebDev, and Firefox in this time.</li>
<li><strong>My <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/j121i?cc=in&amp;lc=en">cellphone</a> can do calls, texts, and radio</strong>. That&#8217;s it. It has worked for me for the past few years, and continues to serve me well.</li>
<li><strong>I lost my cellphone in the middle of the road and got it back</strong>. Yes, my phone fell out of my pocket on the way to work one day. Someone found it, called the last dialed number (my parents), found where I was working, and dropped it off at the office! <em>My friends, however, joke that even someone who found the phone on road don&#8217;t want to be caught dead with it (its purple in color).</em></li>
<li><strong>I read a lot and own a lot of books</strong>. In fact, when I get my own place, I most probably will have a room just for books.</li>
<li><strong>I walk to work</strong>. I have friends who work from home, so you folks will not think this is great, but my friends with an hour long commute will know how precious being able to walk to work is. <em>Walking to work, and taking my bike almost results in the same time due to traffic anyway.</em></li>
<li><strong>In December, I will have completed 5 years of having started a working life</strong>. Looking back to my first job to where I am now, I cannot even think how I landed up this way :-)<br>

    <p><span>The other day I <a href="http://nigelb.me/geek/2011/08/23/looking-for-vim.html">blogged</a> about how I was looking for embedded terminal in vim and found something hilarious. This post is about how I solved what I was trying to do.</span></p>

</div>
<p>I know I can do <code>:shell</code>, but that&#8217;s quite not what I wanted. Here&#8217;s how I got it working the way I want with <a href="">byobu</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a terminal and start <code>byobu</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>C-a S</code>, basically, Ctrl followed by a, and then capital S.</li>
<li>Then, <code>C-a :</code>, so you can type commands to the screen.</li>
<li>Now you can type <code>resize +15</code> to increase the size of the top split</li>
<li><code>C-a Tab</code>, to switch to the other split</li>
<li><code>C-a c</code> to create a new terminal there.</li>
<li>Use <code>C-a Tab</code> to switch between the splits.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li><span class="caps">PROFIT</span>!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d love to make this into some kind of config that I can load, but I haven&#8217;t discovered that yet. If someone knows how, please do let me know in the comments!</p>

    <p><span>On Tuesday, I managed to land a fix for <a href="http://pad.lv/4595">another Launchpad bug</a>. This one probably was my first non-trivial bug fix and also older than any other bug I&#8217;ve attempted (4-digit bug!).</span> Earlier, during page load, Launchpad would take each bug, search if its, valid, get the title, and show tooltips. This feature was removed to reduce page load times and timeouts. Instead, anything that matches the bug pattern gets linked whether the bug is valid or not. Obviously, less friendly, but much faster. One of the days, there was a general complaint about this in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#launchpad-dev">#launchpad-dev</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~wallyworld">Ian Booth</a> mentioned that its probably trivial to fix with the link checking bits he wrote for branches. I jumped in when I saw a chance to get mentored for a bug.</p>

</div>
<p>Fixing the bug involved, first adding a class to all the bug URLs, then grabbing all the URLs with that class and posting it as <span class="caps">JSON</span> to check-links internal <span class="caps">API</span>, which uses the search to verify valid/invalid bugs. Then, it returns a list of invalid bugs. Fixing this including writing python and JavaScript code; a first, for my fixes to Launchpad. I broke a gazillion tests with my fixes though. Twice, I submitted it to ec2 and failed thanks to b0rked tests. Finally, on third try, I caught all of them and its now <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~nigelbabu/launchpad/4595-upgrade-bug-linking/+merge/71575">merged to devel</a>. It is working on <a href="http://qastaging.launchpad.net">QA Staging</a> if you want to give it a try.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon <span class="caps">RDS</span>) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon <span class="caps">RDS</span> Website</a></p>

<p>Amazon <span class="caps">RDS</span> uses <span class="caps">UTC</span> by default. Personally, I think systems should use <span class="caps">UTC</span> by default, but at my work place, all systems are in <span class="caps">IST</span>, which means we want the <span class="caps">RDS</span> to work in <span class="caps">IST</span> too. So, we have this hack of setting the <code>init_connect</code> parameter to <code>set time_zone = 'Asia/Kolkata';</code>. This works great, except when you have to restart <span class="caps">RDS</span>. We&#8217;ve had to restart our instance twice so far, both times leading to considerable downtime, pain, and grief because of this hack (thankfully, the <span class="caps">RDS</span> machine is a backup machine and not used in production).</p>
<p>When it happened the first time, my ex-colleague did the modification and all I did note down was to remove the <code>init_connect</code> parameter. When it happened the second time, I remembered and set the <code>init_connect</code> parameter to an empty string, which I thought would work. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t. We talked to Amazon Support and now I know that when it happens, I should not be setting it to an empty value, but resetting instead.</p>
<div class="highlight">

<p>Often I&#8217;ve noticed that my most productive time is actually at home. So, when I have to spend a few hours of solid work that I don&#8217;t need to depend on a teammate or a teammate doesn&#8217;t have to depend on me, I work from home.

<p>One &#8211; One of our database instances needed to be restarted. After the restart, we couldn&#8217;t connect to it. It took a few hours for Support to get back to us (it was an Amazon <span class="caps">RDS</span> instance) and figure out what was the problem. Our init_connect parameter, in which we put a hack for timezone, was causing the failure to connect after a restart.</p>
<p>Two &#8211; One machine randomly died due to hardware failure on the host. Luckily, I had just launched a new instance which was meant to replace it eventually. Within a few minutes, I switched the IP address with the new instance. Thankfully, there was no service disruption.</p>

<p>Three &#8211; I have a <span class="caps">VPS</span> with a <a href="http://ramhost.us">small provider</a>. This is the <span class="caps">VPS</span> that powers this blog and my <span class="caps">IRC</span> session. In the first week of July, the provider <a href="https://forum.ramhost.us/bbs/viewtopic.php?id=563">notified me</a> that there was some targeted network attack happening on two of their hosts (one of which hosts my <span class="caps">VPS</span>) and they&#8217;ll be power cycling the hosts several times a day. This, of course, brought down my website (for a short while) and my <span class="caps">IRC</span> session (until I manually started it). Note that my website is not high-availability or or hosted with one of the major providers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame the providers for any of these failures/issues. It is and always will be the responsibility of the customer to make sure there are backups and disaster recovery plans in place because the only thing servers consistently do is fail. It maybe after 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, or a decade. But they fail. Eventually.</p>
<p>At a recent conference I attended, there was a <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/phpcloud/28-failure-is-an-option">whole session</a> about planning for failure. This may include making sure that you have backup servers, new servers can be brought up quickly in an automated manner, making sure there is no dependency on a <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2011/03/why-reddit-was-down-for-6-of-last-24.html">single provider or service</a>, making sure the application handles not being able to access another machine gracefully, and much more. I&#8217;ve agonizingly gone over disaster scenarios over the past few days, situations in which any of the servers go down, whether it be App server, DB server, or Monitoring server, or Load Balancer, or even the entire data center, and in conclusion, all I have to say is &#8220;Prepare for failure.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The other day at <a href="http://capillary.co.in">work</a>, I was working on setting up a new database server. This is the first time in a while we&#8217;re doing this. Almost no-one remembers who or how it was done the last time. Our data is kinda big, so we tend to put the mysql data files into an <span class="caps">EBS</span> volume by itself so that we always have the data separate from the machine and because we get as much space as want. We created the new machine, new disk, changed the path of the data folders, and started mysql. <span class="caps">BAM</span>! It threw a whole bunch of errors about permissions.</p>
<p>I went in and checked the ownership, which seemed to be correct, but re-ownershipped everything anyway. Tried again. Nope, didn&#8217;t work. Out of frustration, tried again after doing a <code>chmod -R 777</code>. Still failed. For a while, we googled extensively for the error, leading us to nothing much to go on. Before this, we had some backup stuff to do, so I think it was close to 1 am when we actually got down to troubleshooting this. After sometime, we had the sense to google for what we wanted to accomplish, leading me to apparmor.</p>

</div>
<p>Then, my memory kicked in about Apparmor and what it did. I figured out that mysql probably didn&#8217;t have permission to use other directories. We gave it permissions and it worked! But, we ended up not having enough time to restore data on this new server in and rotate out the old server. Overall, we were working on this from 12 am to 4 am. The next day, my <span class="caps">QOTD</span> was from my friend, who shall not be named &#8211; &#8220;Oops. That said, it&#8217;s happened to me, too. The irony bit is that I&#8217;m one of the primary upstream apparmor devs.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If I do that, I might break Summit!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something often heard at UDSes by organizers. Indeed, Summit has historically had stability issues, especially during the high-usage week of a <span class="caps">UDS</span>. But Summit is starting to outgrow it&#8217;s troubled youth, gaining better code, better testing, and most importantly, more stability.</p>
<p>The Summit team, consisting of Michael Hall, Chris Johnston, and I, has been hacking on Summit much more this cycle than ever. We even had a few new contributors this cycle. Our focus this cycle was to make it more stable first, and then more usable. There are lots of UI fixes that people have requested. We only haven&#8217;t gotten to them because we want Summit to be very stable this cycle. If you&#8217;d like to help us make Summit more awesome, please <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/summit/+filebug">file bugs</a> on things that you think Summit should do or places were Summit sucks. We can&#8217;t promise anything, but its great to nail down things we should fix.</p>
<p>The Summit team has fixed a whole bunch of bugs this cycle. Big shout out to Chris Johnston and Michael Hall for setting the speed of development early on. Before I reached home back from <span class="caps">UDS</span>, there were I think 4 MPs for Summit (!?!). We&#8217;d also like to thank Maris Fogel for helping us setup a test framework. We&#8217;d like Summit to be more stable and having unit tests drives us in this direction.</p>
<p>These are the bugs we have fixed this cycle:</p>

    <p>As I wrote in my last post, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://goo.gl/En6hh">been working on Mozilla input</a>. After the first 2 weeks of my work, I ended up finishing almost all of the easy bugs on the project. On Monday, I decided to tackle one of the more challenging bugg, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614535">bug 614535</a>. The situation in Input is interesting because we often show <span class="caps">LTR</span> text in <span class="caps">RTL</span> localized pages. This bug was about problems with that.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/3276325501/"><img alt="A Sign of the Times by NazarethCollege" src="http://nigelb.me/img/languages.jpg" title="A Sign of the Times by NazarethCollege"></a></p>
</div>
<p>My solution to the problem was to use the locale that&#8217;s associated with each &#8220;opinion&#8221; and mark the text and the name of the locale itself with the correct direction. I had sat down thought about this earlier and also brainstormed with a friend. Our conclusion was to have a list in the settings that would be a list of locales that are Right to Left. I discussed this solution in #webdev, and <a href="http://fredericiana.com">Fred Wenzel</a> told me there already is such a list (Doh! I should have checked). With the general agreement that my solution did make sense, I started to implement it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Input" src="http://nigelb.me/img/input.png" title="Screenshot of Input"></p>
</div>
<p>The above picture is a screenshot of input searches before the fix. Some of the opinions have punctuations slightly messed up. And the locale, English(US), isn&#8217;t displayed properly. Fixing the opinions was easy, I created a new class with property &#8220;direction: ltr&#8221; and applied that class if the locale of the message was not it the RTL_LANGUAGES array. Fixing the locale name was slightly more challenging because its an item in <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> list. Simply adding a class to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> made the bullet point to also switch. This, may be technically correct (because that&#8217;s where you&#8217;d expect the bullet point in an <span class="caps">LTR</span> text), but it wasn&#8217;t an elegant or good-looking solution. I tried to put a span around the locale name, that didn&#8217;t work either. Eventually, with help from #webdev, I went with the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/www.w3.org/WAI/PA/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20070910/H34.html">Unicode left-to-right mark</a>.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t say nailed it, my pull request is pending review.</p>

    <p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been contributing to <a href="http://input.mozilla.org">Mozilla Input</a>. After writing a few small fixes, I started picking up the slightly not-small ones. My fixes ended up breaking tests. That&#8217;s when I ran into trouble. The Mozilla webdevs I&#8217;ve been working with use Mac and I use Ubuntu. With help from <a href="http://farmdev.com">kumar</a> and <a href="http://davedash.com">davedash</a>, I tried debugging my setup to no avail. Long story short, we wanted to all be the same session and try to see the errors and use pdb.</p>
<p>Eventually, davedash gave me a user on an Ubuntu <span class="caps">VPS</span> where I set everything up. Since, the whole point of it was debugging this together, we debugged over byobu. Dave and I both logged into the same byobu session. It was just great for pair debugging. He waited while I setup everything and I watched how he was debugging. Perfect when your teammate is half a world away.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been promising myself to write about my blog setup for a while now. As I <a href="http://nigelb.me/ubuntu/2011/06/08/new-domain-and-summit.html">explained earlier</a>, I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> &#8212; &#8220;a simple, blog aware, static site generator&#8221;. Every time jekyll generates html, it gets dumped to the <code>_site</code> folder. I have my local nginx pointing to the <code>_site</code> folder, so every time I start write blog posts, I open a terminal, go to my blog&#8217;s root folder, and run <code>jekyll --auto</code> and hit my nginx install from the browser. This way, every time I save, I get to see what it looks like. I found this much faster than doing <code>jekyll --auto --server</code> and using the server with Jekyll. I version control the whole folder minus the <code>_site</code> folder with git and I&#8217;ve set up a bare repo on my server to which this will get pushed too.</p>
<p>Jekyll also runs on my server because I want to be able to blog from any machine from which I have <span class="caps">SSH</span> access to my server. I&#8217;ve set up the following commit hook on the bare git repo that regenerates the <span class="caps">HTML</span> files on every push.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="bash"><span class="nv">GIT_REPO</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/blog.git
<span class="nv">TMP_GIT_CLONE</span><span class="o">=</span>/tmp/blog
<span class="nv">PUBLIC_WWW</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/blog-www

rm -Rf <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span class="nb">exit</span></code>
</pre></div>
<p>Its a pretty rad setup. For comments, I&#8217;ve setup Disqus, which was quite easy. I set up askimet with them, so that the spam gets filtered, yet to get spammed though (<strong>knocks on wood</strong>). Overall, the setup has been quite nice and yes <strong>very nerd friendly</strong>. I can write in my text editor of choice and commit to git with complete rollback history if I want to. Not having an admin panel from which things can be changed is a great benefit!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve recently been working with git a lot, more specifically with branches. I love git&#8217;s branching and its fairly awesome. However, its also easy to forget which branch you&#8217;re currently working on (especially awful to find that the commits you did were to master :/). Sometime back I did some extensive searching to fix that situation and finally stumbled upon a neat way to fix it. I modified the PS1 variable to show the current branch! Here&#8217;s what I added to the .bashrc file in Ubuntu :)</p>

    <p>As of me writing this post, there are about <a href="http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/ftbfs" title="FTBFS">428 packages that have failed to build from source</a>. We&#8217;re doing a <span class="caps">FTBFS</span> jam this Wednesday (29 June, 2011). If you&#8217;re interested in helping out, drop by in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#ubuntu-motu">#ubuntu-motu</a> and just generally say that you want to help fix <span class="caps">FTBFS</span> and someone will be able to guide you. We have a <a href="http://corelli.tumbleweed.org.za/ubuntu-qa/bugjam/">list of packages</a> that are potential targets to be fixed.</p>
<p>While we won&#8217;t try to fix everything, we&#8217;ll be focusing on specifc failures, the ones caused by toolchain changes. Ubuntu is changing the way it handles shared library linking. Similar changes are also happening in Debian.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>Before I get into spare details of the reason for these build failures, I&#8217;d like to emphasise that the failures that we&#8217;re targetting to fix are quite easy and just needs some tinkering with make files. I recently fixed a build failure in the redis package. Take a look at the <a href="https://launchpadlibrarian.net/70903387/buildlog_ubuntu-oneiric-i386.redis_2%3A2.2.5-1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz">build log of the failure</a>, <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~nigelbabu/ubuntu/oneiric/redis/fix-ftbfs/+merge/62204">the patch that fixed it</a>, and <a href="https://launchpadlibrarian.net/72523812/buildlog_ubuntu-oneiric-i386.redis_2%3A2.2.5-1ubuntu1_BUILDING.txt.gz">the build log after the fix</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3>Cause of the failure</h3>
<p>For more information on fixing these failures, please see the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ToolchainTransition">Ubuntu wiki page</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/DSOLinking">Debian wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, the linker (ld) would allow indirect linking of shared library symbols. For example, if you had a function spin in the library libwheel, and the library libcar used libwheel, then a program that used libcar would have the ability to call spin even though it never directly used libwheel. This kind of indirect linking leads to fragile code; when the dependency chain of a shared library changes, it can break the program that used it.</p>
<p>ld now runs with the <code>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</code> option enabled by default. This option is also sometimes called <code>--no-add-needed</code>. This means that, in the example above, the spin function would only be available when libwheel was directly linked by adding <code>-lwheel</code> to the command-line compiler flags, and not available indirectly through libcar. Also, ld runs with the <code>--as-needed</code> option enabled by default. This means that, in the example above, if no symbols from libwheel were needed by racetrack, then libwheel would not be linked even if it was explicitly included in the command-line compiler flags.</p>
<p>The solution to a build error caused by indirect linking, is to directly link all needed libraries in the compiler flags on the command-line. For example, if you were previously linking with <code>-lcar -ltruck</code>, you would now need to explicitly add <code>-lwheel</code>. For example:</p>
<p><code>gcc -Wall racetrack.c -lcar -ltruck -lwheel -o racetrack</code></p>
<p>The <code>--as-needed option</code> also makes the linker sensitive to the ordering of libraries on the command-line. You may need to move some libraries later in the command-line, so they come after other libraries or files that require symbols from them. For example, the following link line is wrong, and needs to be changed so that libraries come after objects that use them:</p>
<p><code>gcc -Wall -lwheel -lcar -ltruck -o racetrack racetrack.c</code></p>
<p>When problems result from the <code>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</code> option, the linker will always give you a hint at the right fix in the error message, for example &#8220;try adding it to the linker command line&#8221;.</p>

    <p>As most of you, who&#8217;ve used community projects like <a href="http://loco.ubuntu.com">Loco Team Portal</a> and <a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com">Summit</a> know, we use <a href="http://login.launchpad.net">login.launchpad.net</a> as our open id provider. I believe the future is to use <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/https//login.ubuntu.com">login.ubuntu.com</a>. It is more consitent in terms of design, and is the exact same code as login.launchpad.net but with different configuration and theme.</p>
<p>We have bugs for both the projects to switch to login.ubuntu.com, but it isn&#8217;t really easy because login.ubuntu.com configuration is actually more stricter. We can&#8217;t login from it locally, i.e., it will not pass on my credentials back to my app if I&#8217;m running my app on 127.0.0.1. The <span class="caps">ISD</span> team suggested that I just run <span class="caps">SSO</span> locally and do my testing. After running Launchpad, what could be so hard right? Famous last words ;-)</p>
<p>I fetched the <a href="https://launchpad.net/canonical-identity-provider">source of <span class="caps">SSO</span></a> and started the bootstrap as the instructions said. It failed because some of the configs were in a private branch. With much hair-pulling, head-desking, and lots of help from David and Ricardo, I finally got it running last week. One of the main problems of doing this was the configuration for <span class="caps">SSO</span> are not stored in the &#8220;django way&#8221; of things. It&#8217;s stored as .cfg files with some <a href="https://launchpad.net/configglue">configglue</a> magic. Configglue wasn&#8217;t originally open-sourced and thus the configs were private. The other problem was my inexperience with postgres :-)</p>
<p>After configglue was open-sourced, the configs still sat in a private branch because nobody got around to fixing the bootstrap process, until last week. On Friday, Ricardo finally <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~canonical-isd-hackers/canonical-identity-provider/2.x-trunk/revision/165">gave me the good news!</a>. The bootstrap process is now fixed so that community members can actually run <span class="caps">SSO</span> without hair pulling. We can now easily work on doing the transition from login.launchpad.net to login.ubuntu.com</p>

    <p>I heard about <a href="http://launchpad.net/tarmac">Tarmac</a> a few weeks ago when Shane mentioned it in one of his intern diary blog posts. At that point I didn&#8217;t actually look into it much since I thought it was something that&#8217;s internal to Canonical. Last week, Michael Hall told me about Tarmac again and how they use it to land branches. This time though, I could grasp what it was since it sounded to provide a functionality <a href="https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm">Launchpad&#8217;s <span class="caps">PQM</span></a>. Every time Tarmac is run, it checks for approved branches that are ready to land. If it finds that they satisfy the conditions (optional) that are defined in its config, it lands them. (It can do more, please read the documentation for that).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now running Tarmac for both <a href="http://launchpad.net/loco-directory">Loco Team Portal project</a> and the <a href="http://launchpad.net/summit">Summit project</a>. The really cool commitmessage plugin allowed me to define how each commit should look. I&#8217;ve formatted it in a way easy to figure out how did the review and who authored the change, and which bugs it fixed. If you want to see how it looks like, checkout the <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~summit-hackers/summit/trunk/changes">last few commits for summit</a>. I did find a bug in tarmac documentation for which I now submitted a merge request :-)</p>

    <p>For a while I&#8217;ve noticed that Planet Ubuntu configurations are in a sort of mess. Officially, individuals who are Ubuntu members and some other organizations (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PlanetUbuntu">more details</a>) can post to the planet. But when someone&#8217;s membership expires, cleaning the config is a painful and tedious task. Additionally, there is also no way, other than manual, to verify if the folks with their feeds listed in the planet config file are people with Ubuntu membership. In this regard, I brought this matter up with the Community Council.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/inf3ktion/4477642894/"><img alt="Cleaning by Roosh Inf3ktion" src="http://nigelb.me/img/cleaning.jpg" title="Cleaning by Roosh Inf3ktion"></a></p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<h2>Cleaning up the Mess</h2>
<p>The community council has decided that every feed would be &#8220;owned&#8221; by an Ubuntu member whose launchpad ID should be in the <code>nick</code> field. This will help us run a script to check if all the &#8220;owners&#8221; of the feeds are Ubuntu members. If there are team / organization feeds, an Ubuntu member should put their launchpad ID in the nick field and this individual would be responsible for the feeds of that team. Please note that its OK for an Ubuntu member to sponsor multiple feeds. That way a member of the community can be the sponsor for their own feed as well as an affiliated organisation or sub-project, like in the example below.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="ini"><span class="k">[http://feeds.feedburner.com/nigel-ubuntu]</span>
<span class="na">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">Nigel Babu</span>
<span class="na">face</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">nigelbabu.png</span>
<span class="na">nick</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">nigel</span>

<span class="k">[http://ubuntuclassroom.wordpress.com/feed/?mrss=off]</span>
<span class="na">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">Ubuntu Classroom</span>
<span class="na">face</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">ubuntuclassroom.png</span>
<span class="na">nick</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">ubuntuclassroom</span></code>
</pre></div>
<p>In this example, I should be changing the nick for my feed to <code>nick = nigelbabu</code> since my Launchpad ID is <em>nigelbabu</em>. For the classroom feed, I should change <code>nick = ubuntuclassroom</code> to <code>nick = nigelbabu</code> since I&#8217;m an Ubuntu member part of the team and I&#8217;m willing to own that feed.</p>
<h2>Where you can help!</h2>
<p>If your feed needs fixing, this is how you should proceed. You first need to <a href="https://launchpad.net/+me/+editsshkeys">add an <span class="caps">SSH</span> public key</a> to your launchpad account, if you haven&#8217;t done so already. Then to add your feed, first install the &#8220;bzr&#8221; package if you haven&#8217;t done so already</p>
<p><code>$sudo apt-get install bzr</code></p>
<p>Next, check out the configuration files from the launchpad bzr tree. Please note that I&#8217;ve created a separate branch (<strong>lp:~planet-ubuntu/config/new</strong>) for the new config change that is going to happen. <strong>Remember to checkout the correct branch from Launchpad.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="text">$ bzr launchpad-login yourusername
$ bzr checkout lp:~planet-ubuntu/config/new planet-ubuntu
$ cd planet-ubuntu/@</code>
</pre></div>
<p>Now open up the config.ini file and edit your respective entries.</p>
<p>Once you are done with your changes, commit your change</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="text">$ bzr commit</code>
</pre></div>
<p>Give a meaninful commit message, save, and exit your editor. If you face any trouble or need help, please feel to ping me, nigelb on irc.freenode.net.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fixed about 50 feeds to be owned by the right people. Please find below the feeds that either do not have a nick field, or the name filled in the nick field is not the launchpad ID for an Ubuntu member (the nick is given next to the feed in that case). This list can also be found in a <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/623603/">pastebin</a>. If you know who owns a feed, please feel free to leave a comment so I can update!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve moved my blog from <a href="http://justanothertriager.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> to <a href="http://nigelb.me">nigelb.me</a>. I originally planned to run wordpress here too and export my posts from the old blog here. Unfortunately, that ran into problems. My <a href="http://www.ramhost.us/"><span class="caps">VPS</span></a> wouldn&#8217;t run nginx + php-cgi + mysql at the same time. Every time I tried, I would run out of memory. My first instinct was to increase the <span class="caps">RAM</span>, which I did. But, I looked for a better solution. My friend suggested <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. In Jekyll, basically, the posts are written in markup and then converted to <span class="caps">HTML</span> files. That got me interested, I could eleminate php and mysql out of the picture. That&#8217;s a lot of memory saved to do other things. It took me a fair few number of hours to set everything up. But I&#8217;m very happy with the security (no admin panel really) and I&#8217;ve used git hooks so I write a blog post on my computer and push to the repository, which updates the live site. Awesome and geeky. With a bit of effort, I&#8217;ve gotten <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds and comments working too.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing about summit. If you&#8217;ve ever participated in a <abbr title="Ubuntu Developer Summit"><span class="caps">UDS</span></abbr>, you probably know <a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com">summit</a>. You&#8217;ve probably griped about it a couple of times, haven&#8217;t you? ;) Well, you should also know that summit is <a href="http://launchpad.net/summit">open-source</a> and built on Python/Django. Right now, we&#8217;re looking for fresh blood to come and join us. We&#8217;ve fixed a bunch of bugs post-<span class="caps">UDS</span> and we&#8217;re looking for more people to join us in the fun. I&#8217;ve tagged <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/summit/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize">a few bugs as bitesize</a>. They are quite easy and if you need help setting up the environment and actually going about fixing the bug, please feel free to ping me (nigelb), Michael Hall (mhall119), or Chris Johnston (cjohnston) in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#ubuntu-website">#ubuntu-website on irc.freenode.net</a>. If you&#8217;re a web developer who wants to contribute to community projects other than summit, please take a look at the <a href="https://launchpad.net/community-web-projects">Community Web Projects</a>. I believe we have enough for everyone :)</p>

    <p>At <span class="caps">UDS</span>, I met the Launchpad folks, who encouraged contributions to Launchpad itself in a couple of sessions. &#160;I&#8217;ve tried twice before and always get stuck with the getting a virtual machine set up stage. &#160;This time, I decided that I&#8217;m going to skip that step and go ahead and install it on my lucid laptop. &#160;As soon as I got back, I <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/Getting">Getting the launchpad source code</a>. &#160;rocketfuel-setup is a 400-line shell script that does the heavy lifting of the installation for the user. &#160;After having written such a script at work, I have huge respect for the author of this script :)</p>
<p>After installing, I looked around for a simple bug to fix and picked <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/645825">bug&#160;645825</a>. &#160;The bug appeared easy enough to fix and I had a fix ready in a few minutes. &#160;I proposed a merge and was told that it needs work. &#160;It needs test cases! &#160;Another day I spend with <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mbp">poolie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mumak">jml</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/grahambinns">gmb</a>&#160;and a few hours of learning to write test cases for Launchpad. &#160;Gmb and I used etherpad to collaboratively write the test and I&#8217;ll be honest, that was great fun and very productive. &#160;Multiple tries and we finally got it right and he landed it in ec2 for the entire set of tests to run. &#160;The tests failed.</p>
<p>I quickly popped by #launchpad-dev and <a href="http://launchpad.net/~wgrant">wgrant</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mwhudson">mwhudson</a>&#160;helped me fix and wgrant landed it into ec2 for me. &#160;It passed and I did a qa on qastaging.launchpad.net! &#160;I&#8217;ll be honest that it was an extremely proud moment. &#160;This kind of made me want to fix another bug and I found <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/203478">bug&#160;203478</a>. &#160;This was something that did irk me before <span class="caps">UDS</span>. &#160;This time, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/deryckh">deryck</a>&#160;helped me with writing the test cases correctly first, watching it fail, fixing the bug, and then watch the test succeed. &#160;Did something hugely silly this time. &#160;I was running the test in a new branch and writing code in the devel branch, which would lead to test not being found, fix not being effective and a bunch of problems. &#160;Lesson learned is to use only my branch never the devel branch.</p>
<p>Overall, I liked fixing LP bugs though I&#8217;ve been told that its a brave move. &#160;The Launchpad developers have been extremely friendly and welcoming for new community developers. &#160;I think I&#8217;ll take more time to figure out the more complex bugs, but its fun helping fix the ones I can.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Edit</strong></span>: I missed mentioning &#8211; Launchpad can&#8217;t take a patch until you&#8217;ve signed the contributor agreement.</p>

    <p>A long awaited blog post about the Ubuntu Developer Day. &#160;<a href="http://castrojo.tumblr.com" title="Jorge Castro">Jorge</a> has been saying &#8216;<span class="caps">PICS</span> OR IT <span class="caps">DIDNT</span> <span class="caps">HAPPEN</span>!&#8217;&#160;for a while now. &#160;Anyway, I got all the pictures today morning finally. &#160;I don&#8217;t remember how I first heard of Ubuntu Developer Day, but I remember registering within minutes of it being announced. &#160;I got &#160;a text the previous night reminding me that the registrations&#160;would start at 8:15 am and the sessions would start at 9 am. &#160;The area where the conference was happening was quite close to my place, but with the morning traffic, it took almost 30 minutes for me to get there. &#160;I went along with 3 of my colleagues who&#8217;d also signed up.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nigelbabu/5403781622/in/set-72157625818416551/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="375" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5403781622_4fdfa83175.jpg" title="At UDD" width="500"></a></p>
<br>
Once we got our ID cards, we had a cup of coffee (the daily caffeine dose ;) ), and moved into the conference hall to get good seats. &#160;I&#8217;m guessing there were enough chairs for at least 450 people there. &#160;I&#8217;m guessing there were a few people backing out, because later we saw a ID cards that weren&#8217;t claimed. &#160;Still the crowd was <span class="caps">BIG</span>!
<p>John Bernard from Canonical acted as the MC for the event and we started with Prakash Advani welcoming us. &#160;We learned that people had come from Sri Lanka and Himachal Pradesh (that&#8217;s 2400 km away!)&#160;to be here. &#160;After the welcome was&#160;John Bernard&#8217;s where we are. &#160;He started with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SQoF24ozJw">Discover Ubuntu commercial</a>. &#160;I&#8217;m guessing a lot of people have already seen it. &#160;It set the mood for the rest of the day I guess.</p>
<p>Then came Jon Melamut&#8217;s keynote. &#160;He talked about the chasm among other things. &#160;The talk was mostly things I&#8217;d heard of before and for my colleagues it was very interesting to hear about it. &#160;I don&#8217;t remember a lot of the talks. &#160;I should perhaps have taken notes. &#160;The talks were too interesting to take notes and I&#8217;m hoping the slides will be up some time today.</p>
<p>After Jon,&#160;Dipankar Sarma, from IBM&#8217;s Linux Technology Center talked about the work <span class="caps">IBM</span> has been doing in the Linux space. &#160;His talk was at the kernel level and perhaps went a bit over my head. &#160;After his talk, I saw Ritesh, a Debian Developer I know, standing up and asking a few questions. &#160;We broke for coffee and I chatted with Ritesh for a minute or two before getting back in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nigelbabu/5403779064/in/set-72157625818416551/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="375" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5219/5403779064_32aaf1e974.jpg" title="Tweeting!" width="500"></a></p>
<p>After the break, Chase Douglas talked about the work on touch support in Ubuntu. &#160;This was a talk I was looking forward to. &#160;I had demo&#8217;d the touch devices there and it was really cool to try it out. &#160;Chase did a really nice session and kept things interesting.</p>
<p>Nick Barcet took over for the next 2 sessions. &#160;He took the pre-lunch and post-lunch session. &#160;Now those are the traditionally more difficult sessions to keep people interested. &#160;I have to say, he did a marvelous job of it. &#160;It was great to see the work Canonical has been doing in the cloud and server and how things are going.</p>
<p>After Nick, we had a talk from Freescale and then another talk by Chase about Launchpad and Bazaar. &#160;I had fond memories of <a href="http://doctormo.org/">Martin</a> teaching me about Launchpad and bzr about 2 years back or so. &#160;During lunch earlier, I&#8217;d met Hardik and he showed me the multi touch demo. &#160;That blew me away. &#160;I have to say, it was really cool! &#160;I got to see a number of computer manufacturer&#8217;s in India selling with Ubuntu pre-installed. &#160;Now, I know how which laptop to buy if I buy a new one. &#160;We also got goodies! Everyone got a <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=622">bag</a> which had a <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=736">T-shirt</a> (don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s exact one), a <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=706">pen</a>, a CD, a <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=718">sticker</a>, a <a href="http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=730">notebook</a>, and a few of the handouts about Unity.</p>
<p>Then came the Marvel Keynote. &#160;It was mostly talking about products that Marvel has developed and how its used in a lot of places. &#160;Then came the session perhaps everyone where looking forward to, &#8216;Getting commercial applications to Ubuntu users&#8217; by Randy Linnell. &#160;Most of the talk wasn&#8217;t something new to me, but the audience was quite interested in the talk. &#160;I was tweeting quite a bit during a few of the talks. &#160;We didn&#8217;t have access to the hotel wifi, so I was using my colleague&#8217;s internet connection to tweet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nigelbabu/5403780292/in/set-72157625818416551/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="375" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5403780292_5e7e962fd4.jpg" title="Canonical Team (except for Chase)" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we had a wrap up from Prakash and the audience started trickling out. &#160;I stayed back a bit and talked to the Canonical team who&#8217;d come down. &#160;Later, I grabbed a cup of coffee down at Barista and probably left the hotel at closer to 7 pm ;)</p>

    <p>This post has been long pending to be honest. &#160;We had a <a href="http://nonameconf.in/unconf/start">Noname.unconf</a> planned in Bangalore on 18th and 19th December. &#160;The venue we planned was Jaaga. &#160;It was meant to be a fun place to meet a bunch of hackers with some talks planned. &#160;I met lifeeth, neena, and Hobbes` the previous night when they were setting the place up.</p>
<p>On Saturday when I walked in, I sat at the registrations table, signing up people who came. &#160;We had about 40 people come in. &#160;Interestingly, it was tazz&#8217; and lut4rp&#8217;s birthday. &#160;There was cake and candles and a lot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pratulkalia/sets/72157625534928929/">fun ensued</a>. &#160;I met with a small subsection of the hacker scene that day and it was awesome. &#160;Lot of geeks. &#160;Geeks are different things. &#160;Geeks at networking, web design, sys admin, mathematics, and more. &#160;We were planning on a conf app that day and decided to write it general purpose so it could be adopted any day. &#160;Later that night, we went for dinner together recounting the experience of the day. &#160;Again, good fun.</p>
<p>I went in to day 2 in the afternoon. &#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiemanshu/sets/72157625637629940/">The talks</a> were going on when I walked in. &#160;They were quite interesting including the talk about <span class="caps">UID</span> in India, Debian and Ubuntu BoF, to name a few. &#160; A few more new people to meet that day and then we packed up. &#160;It was a fun weekend of hacking, meeting new friends, and talking to people about stuff.</p>

    <p>There used to be a time when there was this huge maps craze, it has since passed, but Google Maps remains the most recognized map applications seen on the internet.&#160; Recently, I worked on Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span> for a client.&#160; This post is a retrospect look at how it went.&#160; I&#8217;ve not worked with other map systems, so I cannot compare my experience.</p>
<p>My task at hand was to create a store locator that would take an address as input and plot all the points on a map that was within 100 miles of the given location.&#160; A fairly simple map application, except I decided to innovate.&#160; My first stop was the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/articles.html">articles page</a> on the Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span> Reference page.&#160; I found a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/articles/phpsqlsearch_v3.html">very handy tutorial</a> which was exactly about creating a store, wow that made my work much easier.&#160; What I found very helpful from that tutorial was the formula.&#160; this formula.<br></p>
<blockquote><span class="caps">SELECT</span> id, ( 3959 * acos( cos( radians(37) ) * cos( radians( lat ) ) * cos( radians( lng ) &#8211; radians(-122) ) + sin( radians(37) ) * sin( radians( lat ) ) ) ) AS distance <span class="caps">FROM</span> markers <span class="caps">HAVING</span> distance &lt; 25 <span class="caps">ORDER</span> BY distance <span class="caps">LIMIT</span> 0 , 20;</blockquote>
<br>
That is the heart of the entire module.&#160; That forumla returns coordinates that are within 25 miles of a point with coordinates (37, -122).&#160; The complexity (if at all) of the application is to pass data from a database using <span class="caps">PHP</span> or other server-side language and passing into a javascript function.&#160; The tutorial that I was looking at used xml to pass data to the javascript function.&#160; This of course is nice, but I was a bit lazy and a bit innovative.
<p>In my quest for something better, I discovered <a href="http://www.json.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span></a>.&#160; Now, this seemed simple enough since is 2010 and most languages have <span class="caps">JSON</span> support including <span class="caps">PHP</span>.&#160; So, I put all the the results into a hidden textbox as <span class="caps">JSON</span> and wrote a javascript function that would execute on window load.&#160; Using that information, I could then loop through it and mark points on the map from that.</p>
<p>jQuery being an awesome library provided a means for me to do exactly that.&#160; Icould loop through each of them and plot points on the map quite painlessly.</p>

<p>When using infowindows, its very important that the content is stored inside the marker and then used to pop out the infowindow, that&#8217;s the only way that works.&#160; I spend about 5 hours trying to figure that one out.</p>

    <p>Woo! After a while, the Ubuntu loco community is awakening in Bangalore again.&#160; I had announced a meet up on the mailing list a while back.&#160; I had my fingers crossed as to how many would turn up and how it would be.&#160; Most people assured me &#8220;<em>if there are 2 people and the other person isn&#8217;t your imaginary friend, its a success!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to report that we ended up with 7 people coming in.&#160; It started out a bit slow with just me sitting alone in Cafe Coffee Day on Richmond Road.&#160; To be a little more noticeable I opened up the laptop and sat in such a way I could see everyone who walked in.&#160; Anyone who looked lost was definitely looking for the Ubuntu Hour (note to self:&#160; Sticker on laptop sounds like a good idea now).</p>

<p>We talked for quite a bit about what we do for a living and what we do for the free software community.&#160; All of the people seem to be contributing in one way or the other and it was fun to hear about what others do.&#160; We packed up at around 5 and walked out to run into a DD, Ritesh, who was planning on making it but got late.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been looking for a simple to set up viewer for git that would list out all the git repositories that I have on my git server.&#160; It took a bit of a search and I finally discovered <a href="http://viewgit.sourceforge.net/">viewgit</a>.&#160; So far, I&#8217;ve found it pretty nice.&#160; Setting up viewgit is very simple.</p>
<p>Download the tarball from <a href="http://viewgit.sourceforge.net/download">sourceforge</a>.&#160; Extract it to your htdocs or www folder.&#160; Make a copy of <strong>example-localconfig.php</strong> and rename it as <strong>localconfig.php</strong>.&#160; Comment out the line&#160;<code>$conf['projects']</code> and uncomment <code>$conf['projects_glob'] = array('/path/to/repo/);</code> . If like me, you store all your git repos in one folder, this is the best viewer for the amount of work I&#8217;ve had to do. Maybe I should write about how to store git repos in one folder. A story for tomorrow!</p>

    <p>I use git extensively for version control.&#160; Its nice to use git since it backs up the code, but the database still remains unversioned.&#160; Well, thankfully, <span class="caps">XAMPP</span> has a script that does a database dump.&#160; So, I wrote a script to do the dump and then commit it to git.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
Create a directory in the home directory for the database dump<br>
<code>~$ mkdir projectname-database ~$ cd projectname-database</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
Initialize git in the directory<br>
<code>~$ git init</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
Do a database dump for the initial commit<br>
<code>~$ /./opt/lampp/bin/mysqldump -u root database-name &amp;gt; database.sql</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong><br>
Commit the database file<br>
<code>~$ git add . ~$ git commit -a -m "Initial database commit"</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong><br>
Now we&#8217;ll write a script to do the database dump and add commits. Open your favorite text editor and write the following script. Save the file as probably &#8220;<strong>database-project</strong>&#8221; in your home folder<br>
<code>#!/bin/bash /opt/lampp/bin/./mysqldump -u root database-name &amp;gt; /home/username/projectname-database/database.sql cd /home/username/projectname-database/ git commit -a -m "Database dump at `date`"</code><br>
Save the script so that you can run it via a cron.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong><br>
Open crontab with the following command<br>
<code>~$ crontab -e</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong><br>
Add the following line<br>
<code>00,30 * * * * /home/username/./database-project</code><br>
This cron will run the script every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Basically what happens here is the database dump will be taken every 30 minutes and the change will be committed to a git repository allowing you to keep track of the overwriting. I&#8217;ve found it quite useful and I hope you will too.</p>

    <p>So, I&#8217;m a web developer working on Ubuntu.&#160; Since I don&#8217;t want to get into complications like pinning to have earlier versions of <span class="caps">PHP</span> (useful when developing on Drupal), I use <span class="caps">XAMPP</span>.&#160; Its a bit of a work to get php ready to bake while using <span class="caps">XAMPP</span> on Ubuntu.&#160; These instructions are probably generic to any bash shell, but tested and working on Ubuntu.&#160; Also note, I assume you install <span class="caps">XAMPP</span> in the expected directory at /opt/lampp</p>
<p>Step 1:&#160; Add an alias for php in .bashrc.&#160; Open the ~/.bashrc file and add the following line<br>
<code>alias php='/opt/lampp/bin/php'</code></p>
<p>Step 2: When running the bake script, run it as follows<br>
<code>php cake.php bake</code></p>

    <p>CakePHP moved from Javascript helper to a Js helper and they decided to add support Prototype/Scriptaculous, Mootools/Mootools-more, and jQuery/jQuery UI.&#160; Out of the 3, jQuery remains the one I like most so far.&#160; I&#8217;m not an expert in it (yet :p) but its pretty nifty to work with.&#160; Sometimes when working with one or more libraries, the jQueryObject which is <strong>$</strong> by default tends to clash with other libraries.&#160; CakePHP of course has code to deal with this, only is not publicly mentioned how to do it.&#160; I spent around 5 hours to discover how, and here it goes <strong>drum roll</strong></p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code class="php"><span class="x">$js-&gt;JqueryEngine-&gt;jQueryObject = '$j';</span>

<span class="x">    array('inline' =&gt; false));</span></code>
</pre></div>
<p>When you look at the code using firebug, you would now see the jQueryObject changed to <strong>$j</strong>.&#160; I&#8217;ve suggested a section to the book for this and I&#8217;ve also modified some of the documents for stuff that I found helpful.</p>

    <p>When cake moved from 1.2 to 1.3, there were a few changes.&#160; While the manual is up-to-date, the default manual that&#8217;s shown tends to be 1.2 and there is a section in the 1.2 manual that talks about the migration.&#160; I got stuck with one of the gotchas today.&#160; I spent 1 hour trying to find out why the title I set in $pageTitle would not print with $title_for_layout until <a href="http://www.frankdegraaf.net/">Phally</a> pointed it out on <span class="caps">IRC</span> for me.&#160; To set the title from the controller, I&#8217;m supposed to this</p>

<code class="php"><span class="x">$this-&gt;set('title_for_layout', 'My title');</span></code>

<p>Doh!&#160; Anyway, now I&#8217;ve changed my bookmark to the 1.3 manual instead of 1.2</p>

    <p>Its a few weeks since I formally started my career as a web developer and I feel I&#8217;ve got lots to say.&#160; I started working on a project writing <span class="caps">PHP</span> code that mixed with the view, basically a bunch of php files with lots of <span class="caps">PHP</span> code and html.&#160; It was easy, but it wasn&#8217;t great fun.&#160; There was indeed a lot of copy and paste and find and replace, but it was hard work to get things done though it was easier to figure out how to do things.</p>
<p>When I started working on a new project, I convinced my boss that we should try moving to a framework and I chose <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> for some reason though there was <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Codeigniter</a>, and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">Symfony</a> to chose from.&#160; Something about CakePHP pulled me towards it.&#160; It took a fair bit of experimentation before I was able to convince myself that I could do it (yeah, this was after I convinced my boss).</p>
<p>After about a week into development, I can happily say that it is indeed awesome and yummy.&#160; I like the inbuilt helpers and components that helps do a lot of common tasks like access control, pagination, data validation, and others quite easily.&#160; But the best part, is <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/113/Code-Generation-with-Bake">baking code</a>.&#160; It takes a lot of the boring part out of coding for a web application especially when your entire application is a <span class="caps">CMS</span> like system that is somewhat custom made to client requirements.&#160; Being the first project I&#8217;m doing in CakePHP, I think it might take around 2 weeks for this project, but I&#8217;m pretty sure, I can cut down this time to probably a week or less once I get a feel for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got stuck a fair number of times and I&#8217;m really glad that most of my google searches lead me back to the Manual and its mostly what I wanted at that time too.&#160; In some cases I got stuck and lost for hours at a time, and that was when <span class="caps">IRC</span> came to my rescue.&#160; There was always someone online who had a good idea about cake, particularly <a href="http://mark-story.com/">markstory</a> and <a href="http://josediazgonzalez.com/">savant</a>, always willing to help us newbies.&#160; I look forward to more adventures and perhaps more frequent posts.</p>

    <p>Phew, finally I get down to writing day 5 overview, a few days after <span class="caps">UDS</span>.&#160; Generally, I write the previous day&#8217;s blog post on the next day.&#160; After day 5 though, I had to get work (yeah, on a Saturday).&#160; On Friday, I decided to tackle my power trouble by going outside for the hours that I know in advance I won&#8217;t have power.&#160; Overall, good idea, but they decided to cut power at different times.&#160; Sigh.</p>
<p>First thing in the morning was a call with Daniel Holbach to discuss about the Cleansweep Project.&#160; Skype kinda gave us trouble and we ended up using Facebook chat in the end to discuss stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Community Roundtable</strong><br>
A round up in the morning of all the community stuff including what we have to go ahead.&#160; My memory is faint about what we talked, but I vaguely remember everyone summing up the week and the progress that was made.&#160; Also, someone was playing music from Benjamin&#8217;s laptop, which included the <em>Titanic</em> song.&#160; Fun times ;)</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu Women Session</strong><br>
A session I didn&#8217;t want to miss.&#160; This session was very goal oriented from all the other sessions.&#160; I liked the mentorship discussion and revival of the whole thing.&#160; I&#8217;ll probably sign up to be a mentor.&#160; I&#8217;ve already helped a few friends that I know through UW in other teams like Bug Squad.&#160; The idea was not to replace the other mentorship options but to work with the others and to give a list of folks on the UW wiki who can be contacted for particular stuff.</p>
<p>I decided to take a break from the nest session to plan for Operation Cleansweep, a project that I have volunteered to coordinate.&#160; I put up wiki pages and came to the realization that we needed more time to get things together.&#160; I&#8217;d rather have a proper start with documentation everything ready rather than having to wait.&#160; I pinged Daniel and we decided to postpone start date to May 24th, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Lightening Talks</strong><br>
As usual James Tantum rocked us with pictures of slides since most of it were using slides.&#160; I forgot a lot of them, but ones that rocked including one by Jonathan from Launchpad team about &#8216;How to be an evil overlord&#8217; or something to that extent, Popey&#8217;s Momubuntu talk, James Westby&#8217;s talk about launchpadlib (and yes, try try try until you succeed), a talk from Google Chrome guys about how speed matters, Chris Johnston talked about Classbot, Alan Bell about etherpad (we overloaded the pad ;) ), and more that I&#8217;ve forgotten.&#160; I&#8217;ll wait for the videos.</p>
<p>Travis Hartwell talked about how he wanted a way to pull the source for all the dependencies of a package with one command instead of typing out many different commands.&#160; I was pretty sure sed or awk could do something coupled with apt-cache.&#160; My sed foo is pretty low and I asked my good friend Mackenzie Morgan wrote something up for this.&#160; Travis, this one&#8217;s for you buddy<br></p>
<blockquote>apt-get source $(apt-cache depends gwibber | awk &#8216;/Depends/{ print $2&#160;&#160;}&#8217;)</blockquote>
<br>
That command would get you all of Gwibber&#8217;s dependencies.&#160; You can change that package name to get the source of dependencies for any package.&#160; This source will be downloaded into the current folder when you&#8217;re running it from a terminal.&#160; Perhaps someone could make the whole thing more prettier, but hey, this is a start :)&#160; Thanks again maco!
<p><strong>Advocate the use of daily builds<br></strong>One of the projects that Daniel Holbach has been assigned for this cycle.&#160; Its been given a high importance and I realize the reason.&#160; A daily build means every time you write new code, it will be built for you and a whole lot of folks can test it for you and give you bug reports.&#160; Various improvements to LP were discussed including a rollback option among the others.</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu News Team<br></strong>Amber is the chief editor of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, so I attended this one hoping it would be interesting and it was!&#160; A lot of discussion about unifying teams, etc.&#160; There was a thought of doing away with Fridge which I stopped right away.&#160; Reminding you folks again, We <span class="caps">WANT</span> the Fridge!&#160; Well, it wasn&#8217;t a serious consideration but a thought someone had.&#160; All in all, they made some tough calls, which will happen internally.&#160; Also, Fridge is going to be in Wordpress soon, so that should help make a lot of things easier.&#160; I don&#8217;t remember who, I think Joey, will be working with the Design Team for a new theme, etc for the Fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Session</strong><br>
Finally, the <span class="caps">UDS</span> comes to a close.&#160; Everyone had great fun for a week and did lots of work.&#160; Most people were tired and close to burn out (yeah, from all the staying up late in the bar or out partying ;) ).&#160; Seriously, it was tiring.&#160; Even from remote, I was burned out.&#160; Last 2 days I&#8217;ve been so tired.&#160; Hopefully I can recharge this week.&#160; All the track leads summed up their tracks.&#160; Important stuff include Robbie confirming that 10.10.10 could be a release date, pending TB approval.&#160; He was talking about how much time each cycle has had and it seemed okay.&#160; Jaunty cycle only had 25 weeks, so for 10.10.10, we&#8217;ll have only 23 weeks and it seems possible.&#160; Scott, talked about btrfs and how it may be the default option for Maverick.&#160; Keyword there being &#8216;may&#8217;.&#160; <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/2010/05/14/btrfs-by-default-in-maverick/">Scott blogged</a> about what needs to happen for that.&#160; Leann summed up the kernel track decisions.&#160; I didn&#8217;t understand much of it, so skipping that.&#160; Design track, Desktop track, and cloud track also had a small summary which I don&#8217;t particular recall.&#160; This why I should perhaps write blog posts then and there.&#160; Oh yeah, now I remember one decision from desktop, Chromium will be the default browser for the netbook edition.&#160; Finally Jono summed up the community track.&#160; A huge list of summing up.&#160; Most of which I think I&#8217;ve already written in the previous posts.&#160; He announced Project Cleansweep.&#160; Well, he announced it as Project Babu and how it was renamed to Project Cleansweep.&#160; Well, I wonder why I even bothered to oppose if he was going to call it Project Cleansweep a.k.a. Project Babu :D</p>
<p>The final quote from Jono &#8216;<em>Lets get seriously drunk people.</em>&#8217;&#160; He did say he was kidding, but the tone he said it in, was awesome.&#160; Marianna arranged for a treasure hunt and she was given a small token of appreciation from the community for all the hard work she did over the week.&#160; Finally <span class="caps">UDS</span> is over!</p>
<p>Now, time to get to work.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m probably taking the blogging thing too far with 3 back-to-back posts, but whatever.&#160; One big reason I missed out on going to this <span class="caps">UDS</span> was my passport had expired and I hadn&#8217;t renewed.&#160; I finally decided, it was time to re-apply and set out to the nearest Bangalore One to get a form.</p>
<p>It took me 1 whole hour and around 20 km of roaming around to find the place.&#160; Absolutely no one knew the place when I asked around.&#160; Even a policeman I asked gave me wrong directions.&#160; Eventually, I ended up doing everything else on my things to do and was on the verge of giving up when I located the place.&#160; Turns out, its less than 4 km from my place.&#160; Sigh.&#160; I circled around for an extra 10 km.&#160; Before you talk about Google Maps, yes I tried it out there and it didn&#8217;t know what I was talking about.</p>
<p>Overall, Thursday was frustrating in terms of power availability.&#160; I kept on getting power cuts and missing sessions.&#160; The first half of the day was pathetic.&#160; I lost power halfway through the community roundtable and could get back online during the Maverick Governance Changes and Needs session.&#160; I can&#8217;t believe I missed the BugSquad Roadmap!&#160; Again, I lost power halfway through Debian Healthcheck.&#160; Sigh.&#160; Today, I&#8217;ll just go outside to some internet cafe for the first half.&#160; I have a call scheduled and after that I&#8217;ll just go some place for 4 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Community Roundtable</strong><br>
Another general discussion at the roundtable, I lost a bit of that thanks to the power situation.</p>
<p><strong>Maverick Governance Changes And Needs</strong><br>
This session was very interesting.&#160; Though I&#8217;m not any councils, we had a lot of folks from different councils and we were exploring the possibility of working the <span class="caps">CIVS</span> system into Launchpad.&#160; Jono has a task for that and perhaps we&#8217;ll have an awesome voting system by the end of the cycle.&#160; Most of the council elections use the <span class="caps">CIVS</span> system.&#160; We even used the same system for the Beginners Team Council voting.</p>
<p><strong>Debian Healthcheck</strong><br>
This session started with Jorge introducing the good parts and the bad parts.&#160; Zack, the <span class="caps">DPL</span>, was in the session and he gave some good suggestions on how to go about uploading to Debian.&#160; A lot of packages designed for Ubuntu don&#8217;t go into Debian and Zack particularly said that they wanted them.&#160; He explained how we could upload to experimental and sync from there.&#160; We&#8217;ve agreed to do this.&#160; Personally, I agreed to work on Gwibber in Debian sometime back, I guess its time to actually start working on it.&#160; In this case, I had spoken to Ken earlier and he specifically said he was happy to help me.&#160; Any delays are my fault and my lack of time.&#160; As I said earlier, I lost power halfway through this session.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Collaboration with Ubuntu&#8221; Plenary</strong><br>
Stefano Zacchiroli, or Zack, the current <span class="caps">DPL</span>, talked about Collaboration with Ubuntu from the Debian point of view for the first plenary.&#160; This was the most awesome plenary.&#160; Zack totally changed my vision of Debian Developers.&#160; There are more than 1000 Debian Developers and he mentioned that though the option against Ubuntu exists, its a corner case.&#160; His talk encouraged Ubuntu to collaborate with Debian all the time.&#160; Yes, you heard me right.&#160; Debian wants us.&#160; Uploading to Debian would give all the other distros that fork from Debian a chance to get those packages.&#160; He also mentioned that if we have a bug and patch, he wants Debian to get the patch too because DMs and DDs are the people who know the package best.&#160; A growing trend that is being noticed is Ubuntu developers being Debian maintainers and Debian developers!&#160; Wow, that&#8217;s interesting.&#160; All in all, it was a very impressive talk and I&#8217;m waiting for the videos to be uploaded to watch them.&#160; Again, special mention to James Tatum for the pictures.&#160; We all love you James!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;What does this bit do?&#8221; Plenary</strong><br>
James Scott a.k.a. Keybuk talked about the plumbing layer.&#160; The past, the present, the future.&#160; Yes, it was like sitting in &#8216;A Christmas Carol&#8217; about the plumbing layer.&#160; Some of the stuff flew about my head since I didn&#8217;t know much about it.&#160; But it was nice listening to it all the same.&#160; He explained about upstart and how its planned to be awesome in the coming releases.&#160; Can&#8217;t write more since I didn&#8217;t understand much about it.</p>
<p>In between this session, I was also in the Ubuntu Women Project meeting, so I was only listening in partly.</p>
<p><strong>Crystalizing Project Cleansweep</strong><br>
I&#8217;ve agreed to coordinate this project.&#160; Project Cleansweep is about cleaning up all the bugs with patches by Maverick release.&#160; It needs a lot of work and lot of identity to be successful.&#160; Stephan and Daniel Holbach is going to be helping me along with Brian Murray and Jono and everyone else.&#160; We want to get a lot of community attention to this project and use the &#8216;buckets&#8217; that we use in Reviewers Team into coordinating patch review for all the patches in Ubuntu.&#160; I&#8217;ve arranged for a call with Daniel to discuss the specific actions that we need to be taking.&#160; I&#8217;ll be posting more updates as time goes on.</p>
<p>I gave up after this.&#160; All the roaming around in the morning and the 4 days was too much for me.&#160; I switched off <span class="caps">IRC</span>, got off the audio feed, and started planning for Project Cleansweep and what needs to be done.&#160; I hope to have a productive call with Daniel today.</p>

    <p>Day 3 and I&#8217;m starting to feel the strain.&#160; I wonder how the folks there are feeling.&#160; More drained perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Community Roundtable</strong><br>
This was the first session that I attended and we were just having a generic discussion mostly.&#160; I was writing a blog post during the time, since it was mainly just voicing out the concerns that people have had to Jono.&#160; I believe the issue of the Ubuntu mailing list vs launchpad mailing list was discussed, and who to contact for what. Jorge was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m supposed to deal with mailing list requests, ok.&#160; Thanks for telling me.&#160; Never knew.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Improve Harvest Usability</strong><br>
Daniel Holbach has been working on a new harvest based on a Django back-end.&#160; Unfortunately, I lost power in between and missed the last half of this one and the first half of the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging Docs update and initiative</strong><br>
I got power only halfway between the session, but well, I joined in immediately.&#160; The action plan from this list is just awesome!&#160; Lots of great people volunteering to help revamp all the pages and information.&#160; We would really have this awesome set of docs.&#160; One actions decided was to put all the stuff into an LP project so that bugs can be filed against them &#8211; this is way too cool!</p>
<p><strong>Community Maverick Mootbot</strong><br>
Alan Bell was presenting his Mootbot UK project.&#160; I&#8217;ve seen this bot being used in UW meetings and its pretty awesome.&#160; Alan talked about the efforts he put in (and what part sucked).&#160; He&#8217;s got a good list of wishlist stuff for him to do.&#160; Go Alan!</p>
<p><strong>Plenaries</strong><br>
We didn&#8217;t have audio initially for the plenaries unfortunately.&#160; Thank you IS Team for looking into it.&#160; I only know Chris Jones (Ng) and James Troup (elmo) from <span class="caps">IRC</span>, and I&#8217;d like to say, you guys rock!&#160; We got the audio back after the first 2 plenaries.&#160; Alan Bell and James Tatum rocked us with pictures and transcribed the text.&#160; Thanks both of you for helping us out.&#160; Bruno Maag talked about the new ubuntu font and its development.&#160; It was waaay to cool.&#160; He was an absolute font geek and I was totally impressed with the presentation he gave.&#160; Even better, we had more font geeks asking some super cool questions (I didn&#8217;t have a definite idea of what they were talking about in the Q&amp;A time).</p>
<p><strong>Reorganizing and Reviving the Ubuntu Accessibility Team</strong><br>
Penelope has been talking about this for quite some time and I took part in this session because I was guilty of not helping out then.&#160; I&#8217;ve agreed to redo their wiki pages, since its something I do how to do.&#160; I&#8217;ve done this from-the-scratch team wiki for the Reviewers Team before, so this should be easy.&#160; Charlie has also volunteered to help me.&#160; We first started by discussing what we have and then moving to what we want.&#160; We&#8217;ve agreed that this team can rock, but we just need to help people to find out about this and improve the documentation we have.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Review Process Review</strong><br>
This session was something I&#8217;ve been looking forward to.&#160; I was pretty sure the docs had some holes and Stephan has volunteered to help me out with the &#8220;timing&#8221; issue that I&#8217;ve been having making clear.&#160; I needed an experienced Ubuntu Developer to help me out in this part.&#160; Again a bunch of actions assigned to rock the team.&#160; Benjamin is going to work on a script to apply the patch and push it onto a <span class="caps">PPA</span>, which would be rocking.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Review Initiative</strong><br>
We started by Sense talking about Mergimus and how it can help patch review.&#160; Emet and Jono talked about how to bring more people to do this.&#160; We eventually decided on a Project Cleansweep to clean up all the bugs with patches by the release of Maverick (they initially wanted to call it Project Babu, thankfully, they renamed.. phew). I look forward to this project.&#160; We&#8217;ve also decided to work the patch review into the Adopt an Upstream project.&#160; I just discovered that I&#8217;ve been assigned to lead the activity to clear the backlog and generate identity for team, wow!&#160; My display crashed at the end of the session and I had to shutdown.&#160; Phew, its getting more draining as the days pass.</p>
<p>All in all, lots of things to do and lots of rocking stuff going to happen this cycle.&#160; Remote participation has been awesome so far.&#160; Wednesday night was the Ubuntu Women dinner and I&#8217;m sad I missed that, but well, I get to participate without any jet lag ;)</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m posting updates later and later every day.&#160; Right now, I&#8217;m in community round table and I&#8217;m writing a blog post, sigh, procrastination &#8211; how I love thee</p>
<p><strong>Community Roundtable</strong><br>
I ran into some audio issues and power went out half an our into the session, had to step out to an internet cafe and get back into the connection.&#160; We also reminded ourselves that people who become Canonical employees don&#8217;t automatically become ubuntu members or get upload rights.&#160; They still have to go through the same process and don&#8217;t have corners cut if they don&#8217;t have a proper wiki page.<br></p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu <span class="caps">NGO</span> Team</strong><br>
I&#8217;ve heard about this team and it was nice to join in to their sessions.&#160; We made a bunch of decisions including having more regular meetings, perhaps once a month.&#160; Jonathan came up with an idea about Manifest, he&#8217;ll be writing to the mailing list about that stuff.&#160; I had this idea about having documentation for <span class="caps">NGO</span> to set up Ubuntu on their infrastructure and how to migrate to them.&#160; Eventually, Penny and I&#8217;ve volunteer to do this action.&#160; A bunch of more actions were created and assigned out including creating a Facebook group and exploring a planet for NGOs.<br></p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu Support and Learning Center</strong><br>
I feel that this idea is great.&#160; The Ubuntu Manual team intend to put the information from a wiki into a website.&#160; This site would also be translatable.&#160; Now, the Ubuntu Manual Project is a direct competition to the doc team.&#160; Martin (I think) brought up the point that the manual team should be collaborating with the doc team instead of competing because there would be a bunch of duplication that doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#160; So, the action plan is to give the feedback to doc team what made the manual team successful and perhaps integrate that into the ubuntu doc practices<br></p>
<p><strong>Development Workflow Overview</strong></p>
<p>The second session about the development workflow.&#160; This was as productive as the first one.&#160; Among the suggestions was a tool to make patch from a file on the system:<br></p>
<blockquote>make-patch /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/foo.py"</blockquote>
<br>
So, the proposed tool finds the package that&#160; owns the file, grabs the deb, makes a diff of the files installed vs. in the package, and makes a bug/uploads patch against that package.&#160; If we have something like it, that would be really cool.&#160; Another point was advertising how to get fixes into Ubuntu in Launchpad, a small text showing &#8220;Do you want to fix this bug?&#8221; or something to that end.&#160; A lot of the talk was focused on the persona of someone who knows a language and fixes a small bug and wants to get the fix out, but not necessarily interested in ubuntu development.<br>
<p><strong>Diffamation &#8211; Plenary</strong><br>
This was a very interesting plenary which I could experience to any extent thanks to <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ejtatum">James Tatum</a> posting pictures of the slides onto <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel.&#160; I hope the video team posts videos of this stuff!&#160; A lot of the work that Dr. Chevalier presented was using slow animation to display revision changes to code or text.&#160; The immediate application I could think of was scanning commits in bzr or git and also looking at wiki edits.</p>
<p><strong>Open Week and Developer Week</strong><br>
Most of the community sessions were very interesting and this was one of them.&#160; I think having folks in the room that you know and know you changes a lot of things.&#160; We started with discussing what didn&#8217;t work and how we can improve stuff this cycle.&#160; Most significant decision was to make Developer Week earlier in the cycle and rename Opportunistic Developer Week to Application Developer Week.</p>
<p><strong>Software Center Roadmap</strong><br>
I was having dinner during listening to this session.&#160; It was nice to know what&#8217;s coming in the next cycle.&#160; The ability to write reviews and have sale of software is very promising.</p>
<p><strong>Review and Planning for Distributed Development</strong><br>
This session was working into thinking what is going wrong with this and who has issues with this processes.&#160; A lot corner cases were discussed and it was kind of nice.&#160; The best part of <span class="caps">UDD</span> is that its easy to get the maverick (or any release) source code.</p>
<p>So, this overview was very late, we&#8217;re into half the day 3 and I&#8217;m still doing this stuff.&#160; If you haven&#8217;t looked into the <a href="http://ubuntudevelopers.blip.tv/">Ubuntu Developer channel</a> on blip.tv, now is the time to do it.&#160; New videos are being added daily.</p>

    <p>No, I&#8217;m not in Belgium.&#160; I participated remotely and this is a summary of the sessions I participated before fatigue hit me.&#160; Being a couple of hours east of Belgium, the sessions start at 12:30 PM for me, which is very comfortable.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Yesterday, we started off with Jono Bacon giving the Introduction plenary.&#160; We had some trouble with the audio until <a href="http://www.grantbow.com/">Grant Bowmann</a> figured out that the icecast was on the bois_dentelle link.&#160; We folks missed out on seeing the slides initially, but some very nice folks in the room posted pictures from their phones or described what was happening out there.&#160; Yes, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jtatum">James Tatum</a>, I&#8217;m talking about you.&#160; Thank you posting those pictures and giving descriptions and helping us out!&#160; It made me feel like I was really there.&#160; There was this video being played and I really missed it because I could hear the background music and the snickering.&#160; Someone was kind enough to <a href="http://ubuntuone.com/p/34q/">post the video on their Ubuntu One account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Shuttleworth Keynote</strong><br>
He gave a nice talk and also introduced Unity to us.&#160; There is a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~canonical-dx-team/+archive/une"><span class="caps">PPA</span></a> for unit if you&#8217;re interested.&#160; Thank you <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3601671">Alan Pope</a> for posting the videos.&#160; I think he&#8217;s got all of them.&#160; Also, Canonical video team posted Mark Shuttleworth&#8217;s keynote, they are on the <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3603061">blip.tv channel.</a></p>
<p><strong>Community Roundtable</strong><br>
Again, it took some trouble to get the sound working here, but eventually that got sorted out.&#160; Turns out, its easier to go to http://icecast.ubuntu.com:8000/ and select the room you&#8217;d want to listen to.&#160; The bot which posts the links had a mistake in its link if I remember correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Development Workflow Review</strong><br>
A quick review of the places where we face problems in the development workflow.&#160; We made quite a bit of progress.&#160; I believe this discussion will be continued further on Tuesday&#8217;s session.&#160; I lost power in the middle of the session and had to walk to the nearest computer cafe to listen to the session.&#160; They had bad headphones too.&#160; (I think Ubuntu has a sound boost compared to windows? Untested but my instinct tells me so)</p>
<p><strong>The Design Team Plenary</strong><br>
Ivanka Majic gave a great session.&#160; <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3602218">Popey has the videos for these too!</a>.&#160; <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jtatum">James Tatum</a> helped us on this plenary by posting pictures from his phone.</p>
<p><strong>Qt Overview</strong><br>
A guy from Nokia explained about Qt (pronounced &#8216;cute&#8217;) and their development workflow.&#160; Interesting talk.&#160; I think <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jtatum">Jtatum</a> posted all the slides from his phone for this one.&#160; A big thank you from the remote guys.&#160; We <span class="caps">LOVED</span> it!</p>
<p><strong>Quickly</strong><br>
Rick Spencer got up there to talk about some of the improvements they have done to Quickly.&#160; It was awesome! <a href="http://popey.blip.tv/file/3602315/">Popey&#8217;s video again save the day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LP Improvements for Patches</strong><br>
Jorge took the lead on this session.&#160; It was very productive session with a room full of some amazing people!&#160; People who knew what was the trouble and what needs to be done.&#160; I liked a lot of ideas that Pete had with regard to kernel patches and how they take care of it</p>
<p><strong>LP Improvements for Bugs</strong><br>
Jorge had some crazy ideas at the beginning, which while being crazy was really innovative.&#160; Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get to see those features pop up. Bryce, you rock!&#160; Bryce made a cgi script to post the bug to the upstream bug tracker somehow and I think it was was called &#8220;Bryce has implemented Pedro&#8221; ;)&#160; Also, I think it was Pete, who expressed his concern about bug hijacking and what we could do to counter.&#160; Some of the proposed ideas looks good like bug supervisors marking comments as useful and being able to see only the useful comments, especially when bugs have 400+ comments and most of them are not useful to the developers or triagers.&#160; I feel this is a great step ahead indeed!</p>
<p>In other news, Pitti and Bryce and moving out of Desktop and X Team respectively for a rotation.&#160; I don&#8217;t know where Pitti is rotating to, but Bryce is rotating to the launchpad team and having worked with Bryce once or twice, I know this is going to be the great cycle.</p>
<p>By the time this session was over, I gave up and decided to take a break.&#160; Overall, it was a very good day.</p>
<p>Edit: It was Jfo, not Pete. My bad.</p>

    <p>No, this is not a post about my girlfriends or my love life.&#160; Today is <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a> and planet should be filled with blog posts about it.&#160; After starting to contribute to Ubuntu, there are are couple of women whom I&#8217;d like to appreciate for their contributions to Ubuntu and for mentoring/helping me when I got stuck</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The first team that I was part of in Ubuntu was the Beginners Team and from there on I&#8217;ve worked with pleia2 (as we all know her) as part of the <span class="caps">UCLP</span>, Classroom Team, and User Days Team.&#160; Its wonderful how she gives critical input to help see all angles to an idea and make it rock solid.&#160; I also wonder how she managed to spend so much time in between work and real life with us online creatures ;)</p>

<p>I would have never known that quilt is something other than a type of bedding if it wasn&#8217;t for maco.&#160; I just popped by #ubuntu-motu and was looking for some pointers to start motu work.&#160; She guided me step by step through my first bug fix, understand the packaging process and quilt, and sponsored the package too.&#160; I still use the logs from that conversation way back in October or November when I&#8217;m working on quilt.</p>
<p>Hugs to you <a href="http://princessleia.com/">pleia2</a> and <a href="http://ubuntulinuxtipstricks.blogspot.com/">maco</a> for being part of Ubuntu and being there to help.</p>

    <p>In my <a href="http://justanothertriager.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/installing-packages-without-an-internet/">previous post about Keryx</a>, I had mentioned there are 3 different ways to bring .debs from another system to your own, but I skipped explaining APTonCD because (a) those packages need to be installed on another Ubuntu system, (b) that system must be running the same release of ubuntu as yours &#169; it gives an output of an iso file or has to be written to CD. This makes it non-ideal for bringing specific packages from one system to another system.</p>
<p>APTonCD though is the <em><strong>perfect backup tool</strong></em>. When you want to reinstall your OS for some reason (like playing with it too much that it does not work), APTonCD is the tool to use. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward. Once installed just run it from <em>System &gt; Administration &gt; APTonCD</em>. Click on <em>create</em> and all the applications installed will be listed out. Then click on <em>Burn</em>, and viola all the packages that you&#8217;ve installed gets backed up onto a CD, <span class="caps">DVD</span>, or iso.</p>
<p>After reinstalling the OS, pop the CD or <span class="caps">DVD</span> that was burned earlier into the CD drive, run APTonCD (install it first), and click restore. Now all the .debs will be copied to apt cache. Now go to <em>System &gt; Administration &gt; Synaptic Package Manager</em> and go to <em>Edit &gt; Add CD-<span class="caps">ROM</span>.</em> Then click on <em>Origin</em> in the bottom left and all those packages will be listed and can be added.</p>
<p>All the applications installed will be restored. If like me, you have /home on a separate partition, not much configuration required either.</p>

    <p>On the Ubuntu desktop, it is difficult for a user stuck without Internet because all packages are directly downloaded by the package manager. In India, unfortunately, Internet is not available for everyone. If you&#8217;re is lucky to have a laptop <span class="caps">AND</span> have a friendly local Internet Centre where you can connect your laptop, you&#8217;re among the few who can browse on Ubuntu (apart from those who have Internet ;)). I&#8217;ve been searching for a way to download the packages off-line and then install at home for people from my LoCo.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="http://fullcirclemagazine.org/issue-32/">Full Circle Magazine</a> had an article giving a few workarounds for this, including a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Synaptic/PackageDownloadScript">script generated by Synaptic Package Manager</a>, APTonCD, and Keryx. The 2 most attractive options are to generate a script from Synaptic Package Manager and <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx Project</a>. They let you download on systems without Ubuntu and bring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29">.deb</a> files to Ubuntu.</p>
<p><strong>Generate a Script from Synaptic Package Manager</strong><br>
Start Synaptic Package Manager and mark all the applications that you want to install/upgrade. Instead of clicking the &#8220;Apply&#8221; button from the toolbar as you would normally do, go to the File menu and select &#8220;Generate Package Download Script&#8221; menu option to generate the download script. Save the generated script file. Give it a name like &#8216;ubuntu.sh&#8217; and click the &#8220;Save&#8221; button. This script file can now be carried to a machine which has a fast Internet connection and it needs to be executed there.</p>

<p>To download the softwares on a Windows machine, use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/190">Linkification plugin</a> to convert text links into genuine, clickable links. Then, use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201">DownThemAll plug-in</a>. When the plugin in installed, go to Tools &gt; DownThemAll and include *.deb in fast filtering. If downloading from another Ubuntu machine, just type <em>sh .sh</em> in terminal after changing directory to the folder containing the script.</p>
<p><strong>Keryx Project</strong><br>
The <a href="http://keryxproject.org/">Keryx Project</a> only needs to be installed on the system with Internet connection and it downloads the debs. The best about Keryx is that its compatible with Ubuntu/Debian, Mac, and Windows. Download the <a href="http://keryxproject.org/download/">Keryx Project from their download page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://keryxproject.org"><img alt="Keryx Project" class="aligncenter" height="405" src="http://keryxproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/keryx-colage.png" title="Keryx Project" width="500"></a></p>
<p>There is an excellent tutorial on using Keryx by <a href="http://crashsystems.net/2009/01/keryx-tutorial/">crashsystems on his website</a>.</p>
